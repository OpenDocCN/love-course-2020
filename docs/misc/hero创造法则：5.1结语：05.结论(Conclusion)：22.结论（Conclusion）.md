# hero创造法则：5.1结语：05.结论(Conclusion)：22. 结论（Conclusion）

so now we've explored an extreme depth，what it means to let go，you have that awareness，how to let go。

you have that proof，and how to dig up，except and reawn everything，that's buried in your subconscious。

inorder to ultimately let go of all of that，is well and make this pertinent，the final question。

that I get all the time， is，well，How long does this take，I get it，I have the awareness。

I have the proof，I know that I have to，divine to my subconscious，在原來我是我以為，走創我，幾hr，可是我會合照，整個成本的矩位。

然後我就說，想 beneficially，能預宜一點，但是， How long does it take， til I go of everything， How long does it take。

是理會呢，的確， How long does it take， until I'm 100%， self-actualized，然後最後，我我會交給大家，這空間，你要認識，是為他們，是，如果，你有空。

為你我要，質疑，然後 пр stage，要，就是說不行，， Vo g al le gov， Yo， Musharoh，哞音，託過的，那一刻， How long does it take。

 until I am 100% self-actualized， and what I will tell you here， is that if you're viewing this。

 is something to accomplish， where there is an end goal， where to you right now。

 you're hanging on to all these things， and you have to VSmeel LA gov in order。

 to reach that point where， There， there's nothing more to let go of，I have reached the finish line。。

I have made it，， if you're viewing this that way，， you're going to keep reinforcing。

 that you haven't made it right now， and you're going to keep propeling that。， Okay。

 because trying to make it， is a continuation of you not having made it right now。， And remember。

 as we previously discussed，， as long as you're operating in a certain paradigm，。

 you will not find a way out of that paradigm。， So you can't view it that way。， Okay。

 be careful not to fall into this paradigm，我現在又ier LEWatcher，這是不是因為mat，記住了，我要說一句，這是不了仰臣騎場，我就會被暫舉。

這個沒有 another reason，去amtiling yourself，去 by yourself，研究中，但還疼把所有人弄羊，完全 cupping，發現他們是交換，我拯救了他，有漠那一種。

你真的明白這個，你現在要範圍，對，就是自己我忘了，在想妳 君na，我在想那一種，可以令當住，讓我醉掉，可以得到， gear，妳我就覺得她最愛，OK。

 what if I told you right now that no matter what you did， no matter how hard you tried。

 you would never make it。， You would never reach that point。。

 You're going to give up on trying to make it。， You're going to give up on trying to reach that point。

， And what's going to happen by giving up on trying to achieve this， you'll achieve it。。

 That's the journey。， OK， it's by giving up on trying to make it that you make it。。

 And if you think about it too， it's like when you give up of trying to make it，。

 trying to reach that finish point of being so obsessed with that destination，。

 always focused on the future。， You'll finally let yourself off the hook。。

 You'll finally enjoy what's going on now。， You'll enjoy life。。

 You'll enjoy the journey that is life。， You'll enjoy the process， which is what this is all about。。

 And you'll stop beating yourself up for not having met that condition。， And as I mentioned before。

 we have this skewed view of what enlightenment is，。

 or we think that enlightenment equals perfection。， OK。

 and this is an ideal that is born out of escapism。， You need to let go of it。。

 The goal is not to always be at peace， to always be positive，， to never be judging。

 to always be grateful，， to never come from scarcity， et cetera， et cetera。， It's not this。。

 Let's run away from this and get there。， Let's run away from hanging on to things and get to that point。

 where you never hang on to anything。， It's about accepting everything。， That's how you let go。。

 Let go is not to get somewhere。， It's let go of trying to get somewhere。， There is nowhere to get。。

 OK， and again， this ideal of enlightenment is perfection。， No one is there。。

 And even if someone is in that state there，， it's not enlightenment because now they fear the opposite。

， What we're aiming for here does not have an opposite。， Perfection， if you will。

 is letting go of perfection。， And with this practice too， don't be so serious about it。， It's like。

 I'm in a hurry and it's very serious until when do I reach that goal？， Fuck。

 I hate myself until I get there。， No， fuck that goal。， That's not what it's about。。

 It's not about being serious， hating yourself。， Must be perfect。， Must be perfect fast。。

 Must do everything perfectly。， Must do this all the time。， No， it's a serious matter。

 but you can't do it in such a serious way。， OK， remember， coming from abundance， really thriving，。

 is when you're alive and enjoying life，， and there's that light in the pupil，。

 and you're just radiating just like， you're there。， That presence， it's not， let's do this。。

 Let's let go。， Fuck that。， That's coming from scarcity。， OK， don't be so serious and miserable。。

 And what you realize is that the more awake you become，， the more you laugh。。

 There's one way of kind of seeing where you're out on the journey。， How much are you laughing？。

 How much are you smiling？， How much of the light is there in your eyes？。

 Versus how disciplined you are。， And again， the way you should view this is， it's a way of life。。

 It's not the sprint towards an end goal。， There is no end goal。。

 It's a way of life where you just continuously let go， of that fucking end goal。， OK。

 make this a practice， make this a habit。， It's just something that you do。。

 You can do it in the morning。， You can do it in the evening。， As you'll see in the next section，。

 there is a guided morning release and a guided evening release。， And just keep doing those。。

 And just do them for the sake of doing them。， OK， enjoy bringing awareness to those parts of you。

 that you haven't brought awareness to。， Enjoy rediscovering yourself。， And all the while， too。

 it's like you already have that knowing， that you're there。， You have that proof。。

 It's like you're there。， And these habits are not meant to be little tools to get somewhere。。

 It's just sometimes you can spend with yourself reconnecting to， that state of abundance。。

 That's what it is。， You're not doing it to achieve something。。

 You're doing it for the sake of doing it。， OK， and you already have that knowing。， And from there。

 every single day， just enjoy getting back and touch。

 with that and amplifying that knowing even more。， There is no destination。。

 If you hang onto that destination， you'll just end up trapped。， Let go of the destination。。

 You're there。， You've made it。， Stop telling yourself you haven't made it。， Drop that paradigm。。

 And this is transformation mastery。， This is what changed my life。， I mean， as I mentioned before。

 I first got into this whole world of， self-help personal development back in 2006。。

 So I've been in this for over 10 years。， And if you look at my journey。

 the past two years since that， media scandal， and since I became aware of all this and started working on this。

， my transformation these past two years tops those first eight years。， And those first eight years。

 I went all out。， There was a lot of effort。， A lot of just really hustling and just trying to optimize everything。

， Like I went all out。， But those eight years versus the past two years，， I mean。

 you can't even compare。， Okay？， The personal transformation I experienced the past two years has been so drastic。

， Nothing compares with it。， And I mean， yeah， this is why I created this for you to， you know，。

 transform that same way there。， And what it realizes that hey， when you start getting to the cause，。

 when you stop fiddling around with the effects，， when you apply this。

 transformation will just be fucking effortless。， And it'll happen fast。
