# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：2.如果你被困在你的头脑里

For you right now if you look at the crowd，Is he in his body or in his head？，Is he in his head？。

How can you tell？ You can look at the crowd，Don't be scared，You look tense，Ok，Now this look here，Ok。

I'm looking into the audience like，Is this okay？，Am I doing alright？，Is this acceptable？。

Like that look，Is the look that I see，In almost every single person's face，At the beginning。

Of every single live event，And it's just crazy to think about。

Like when I walk up on stage in the beginning，And I look into the audience，This is what I see。

You know it's very rare that I see，People who are connected to the world around them。

Who are interacting with the world around them，And it's very rare that I see people who are connected to themselves。

You know occupying their entire bodies feeling，What I see instead is this。

I see people who are trapped，In their heads，Tracked in the jail of their mind，You know they escaped。

The world must retreat from the world，And they've escaped themselves，Must retreat from myself。

And they are just in this little space here，In this state of anxiety，Of pain， constant worry。

Where do I stuck up？，What do people think of me？，Is this ok？，Is this ok？，Is this ok？。

Is this acceptable？，Like that's their existence，And this is again due to the way the word conditions。

And with PC，This we previously discussed，It's just getting worse and worse and worse。

To the point where almost nothing is acceptable anymore，You know if you're born now。

And you're raised in，You know today's PC world，You're taught very fast that，This is not ok。

That is not ok，Don't speak up，Don't do that，Don't put your hand on the table。

Don't state that opinion，Don't say this word，And it's just so fucking scary，That you just，Woof。

Withdraw from the world completely，And you feel just so horrible，There's so much anxiety。

That you withdraw from yourself，You withdraw from the world，You withdraw from yourself。

And you're just stuck in this little，The last bit of your body，Let's just say， stuck in your head。

Yeah，I mean it's just absolutely insane，I see it in，In the dating world too，You know。

 teaching success with women，Where，More and more guys are coming on these programs。

And they can't even make themselves heard，You know， even sitting on a restaurant with me。

 Before having just a casual conversation on a restaurant，I can't hear them，They show up like。

 hey Julian，I can't hear you，You're gonna have to speak up，What，You're gonna have to speak up。

We're in a restaurant here，If we go out like say to a bar club，No one's going to hear you，Okay，Yell。

Yell，Like that's the world that we live in，People are just，Trapped。

And you can just see the pain in his eyes，You know， like that look，That was me by the way，Just。

 again， that was my entire existence，You know， from when I was born，I was always in that state。

That three out of ten，You know，And when I see this in a crowd。

I'll look for people who just really stand out，Like there are different extremes of this。

But when I saw him just sitting there，Just come on up。

Like those are the people I just immediately bring up front。

And my goal is to just shake them out of it，It's to wake them up，You know。

 and this is something that，You know， like he needs an outside force，To just wake him up。

Like you need to make someone experience this，For him， more knowledge about the topic too。

Because that's the go-to，It's like， what am I？，In my head，But some more knowledge is like no。

 you need someone，An outside force to just shake you the fuck out of it，Let's do one by one。

And what you'll see again， like proof-not promises，I'll go first， then try to talk me。

I'll go first and try to talk me，Okay？，I'll even start quite，Hey，I'll even take this off，Hey，Hey，Hey。

Hey，Hey，Hey，Hey，Hey，Hey，Wait a minute，What？，Try again，Solo，Hey，Even more。

Just keep trying to top yourself every time，Hey，Hey，Hey，Even more，No，Even more，Come on，Even more。

One last one，Hey，Loud，Hey，Hey，Hey，Good，So this is an exercise that I love to do。

And it just kills it in terms of waking people up，You know， getting them out of their heads。

Is the back and forth yelling，You know， where I go first， I'll yell，And I'll have him taught me。

And then I'll yell a little bit louder，Have him taught me，You're a little bit louder。

Have him taught me，And then he goes all out，And the reason this works so well is because。

When I go first， it gives him permission that it's okay to go that loud，And。

You'll see this sometimes in big crowds，You know， I remember I was setting up a seminar room in Canada。

In Winnipeg， I believe，Or Calgary，Winnipeg or Calgary，And I walk in。

And I'm setting things up and you know people start coming in already。

And everyone is super fucking quiet，You know， and I'm like， well you guys can talk you know。

 we're gonna start in 15 minutes，And they're still extremely fucking quiet。

And it's not that they didn't want to talk，Is that the norm was just so low，They're like， is it okay？

，No， is it okay？，But what happens is as soon as someone speaks up。

It gives everyone else permission to speak up to，So you just need one to go first，You know。

 and that's what I do here， By me going first， it's like，I guess it's okay，Okay， I can go first。

And I kind of just bait him that way，And then kind of send him off on his own。

And he does that amazing，You know， last scream，And then of course like to have the crowd。

They're supporting you and cheering you on，I mean， that's like the positive reference you need。

You know， kind of tips that balance of，You know， your entire life，Don't scream， don't scream。

 don't be loud，Shut the fuck up，Here it's like， fuck it，Bang！。

And you just let loose and experience again，That glimpse of authenticity。

We're not used to even screaming like this，We're letting loose ever，We're like holding back。

And I can guarantee you now，It's like， although it's like probably scary at first。

You're probably like， even your posture now，A lot more，At ease，No，Not perfect。

 but a lot more at ease，You're like， oh shit，Probably a lot at ease，You do that at second time。

Probably a lot more freeing，You know， this is the same when， like singing。

A lot of people have like a huge blockage with singing，Yeah when you start to sing。

And then you realize nothing bad happens，Oh， and then you kind of get on this flow，Look at him now。

You know， look at that vibe，Look at that aura，After the scream versus the beginning，You know。

 in the beginning，Just by doing this little screaming exercise，You see him like this，And his head。

And now it's like， ayy，Wow，You're back in your body，Back in touch with the world around you。

You put yourself out there，There's no longer this，Blockage。

You just see that aliveness kind of kick in，That light and the pupils just kind of kick in。

Just by doing that，And it's insane，You know， just that， Like， even me now。

If I bring my awareness only into my head，And observe the difference in the vibe here。

If I'm like this，This is me in my head，So yeah， I'm in my head right now。

You can just sense even the way I talk now，It's very um。。。，There's not that depth to it。

Me in my body，So I'm talking now，And I'm occupying my entire body，There's a little bit more depth。

The voice is a little bit more rounded， A little bit more grounded。

But I'm still cut off from the world，I'm just in my body，Now if I put myself out there like， okay。

Woo，Interacting connected to the world，This is how I talk now。

And there's even just the smile that automatically kicks in，BANG，Okay， notice the difference，And uh。。

。all，You know， someone needs is that little bit of a push，Now just to make it clear here too。

This exercise， this doesn't cause any permanent change，Okay， but what it does do。

Is it gives him that glimpse，It gives him that reminder of what being authentic feels like。

What he'll then have to do is，Let go of all the blockage that's there，So。

 we're gonna get back to you，Just do with the crowd here，Just to kinda fuck around。

Let's split it into，We're gonna do the A， A，And basically， you go first，You top that fucking side。

Then you top them again，And we'll just keep going like that，So， just， hey like that，This side。

This side，Good，That's the reaction by the way that I fucking love，We're doing it。

 it's like everyone together，And notice how a few of you are still inspired to still keep fucking yelling。

Because you're like that，It's same as that，You're like holy shit。

I did a bit nothing bad this feels even more，It's like that's what you're inspired to fucking do。

And during that last time， especially like you guys been inspired to do it。

It's like you're not fucking forcing it，It's not like， ah willpower， it's like it just comes out。

You know，And that's like the ideal here，And I love this，You know。

 it's like we do the exercise with the crowd，And I'm like okay， everyone stop。

And there's still a few people who keep on yelling，And the reason they keep on yelling is they've。

Connected with themselves again，They have the glimps of authenticity of a liveness。

And they just don't want to let it go，You know， if you've been stifled just walking around。

And your head for so long，And suddenly you have that opportunity to put yourself out there。

You reconnect with yourself，You don't want to let that go。

And it just shows like how in need of this we are，You know。

 and there are really not that many environments either，That promote you doing something like this。

You know， where else are you really going to let loose like this。

Where else are you going to scream like this，You can't do it at your job。

 you can't really do it with your friends，I mean I guess you could do it in the street，You know。

 maybe your house or apartment，But depending on where you're staying，You might， you know。

 your neighbors， my bitch，This is one of those environments that provide you with the opportunity to really。

Put yourself out there，And um， I love it too because those last screams。

Those are really those genuine authentic screams that come from a place of inspiration，You know。

 it doesn't require effort，You know， the first one is my required effort to kind of get the ball rolling。

You're like scream， scream， and then it just kicks in，And you're like， fuck yeah。

 and you just go with it，Um， those are those authentic screams，Now we're going to take it further。

 here we're just doing it with screaming，Um， let's do，I'm going to blast some fucking music，I know。

 this is your probably like， fuck this shit，Alright，Now， notice here， okay， catch yourself。

 it's like what are you doing here？，You're trying to warm up to get somewhere，Can you do more space？。

No， no， no， for now， just stand still，Look at the crowd， don't escape the crowd。

And just kind of stay with your emotions for now， I get a set up，Okay， because notice that too。

 it's like， oh we try to escape it，And you're trying to warm up for something。

It's not something you need to warm up for， it's something you need to unleash。

It's like it's there once you get out of your own way， Effort， like think， ego equals effort。

Every time there's effort and it's heavy， it's not coming from the right place，Okay。

 now I don't have， what song？， Any recommendations？，No， let's get like a dance-yish song。

This girl by whom？，This girl， is that， wait， is that like a Danish thing or no？，This girl？。

Can't stop this feeling，Oh by kung， got it， got it，I hope this is good，Now， in terms of。

 let's do this，Let's just rate it in terms of looseness，Okay， in terms of looseness， let's just。

 we'll both put like， Both arms up when it's like really loose， both arms down when he stiff。

So you can kind of just dodge by the audience，Okay， let's go，Whatever you feel inspired to do。

 don't even think， just fucking do，And you can do halfway， you can like rate it，Now， alright， good。

 now here's what happened，Start it off a little tense， then you started seeing， oh。

 a few people raised it，And you did start loosening up， but then you stagnated in those same moves。

Keep， it's all good， keep riding that wave， where it's like，Every time you're kind of like。

 you want to reach that point， you're not even conscious of it，Where you're just like， yeah， fuck it。

 just like， whatever the fuck，It's like， don't try to be cool， just like。

 whatever the fuck kind of comes to mind， just do，And don't like。

 as soon as you kind of catch yourself， be subconscious， be like， yeah， fuck， like。

 disrupt that pattern，Okay， back at it， going now，Even loose， or loose， or loose， or loose。

You can close your eyes a bit if you want to， Whatever the fuck， it comes to mind。

 Be willing to smile， the smile is good， that's what you want，You want to smile， be laughing， like。

 the blast， Alright， feel free to join in by the way， whatever you guys want to do， Like。

 try to get that really loose vibe， Like， fully loose， Even loose， or， smile， you better be smiling。

 Now pause， you join him on stage， I can always tell， this is what's like， you can always tell。

 Who's still in their fucking head， like everyone's kind of like， slowly loosening up。

 And you're just like， Yeah， deep breaths， deep breaths， deep breaths。

 So you see that same fucking look in the eyes， like， there's another one， again。

 if you attend that event， and I see that， you're coming up， Let's start with a couple of yells。

 Wait a while， yeah， Now， good， but forced， I want like that， Hey， longer， even more。

 It's not forced， it's like， just kind of let go as you yell， Hey， like。

 even do it with the arms and the smile， Hey， hey， hey， even louder， like， join in， let's do it， Hey。

 hey， hey， that was， Hey， hey， a lot better， now you're going back in your head， stay with it。

 stay with it， stay with it， Don't be James Bond， let go of all this shit， It's like。

 you're not trying to be cool， you're just like， hey， like， you're the fat fucking American， Like。

 hey， yeah， fuck yeah， Hey， hey， just like， again， think， fat American， opposite， Finnish guy。

 Don't act like the Finnish guy， be the obnoxious， loud， loose， fat fucking American， Hey， hey， hey。

 good， let's get you to dance， Okay， so he's doing better， and what I like about this too is。

 by me saying， stopping cool， stopping James Bond， Stop trying to do so well。

 I'm killing that front that's stifling him， And this is important to understand。

 so he's putting on this front of， you know， James Bond must be cool in front of the crowd。

 That's a coping mechanism， if you will， you know， that's the fakeness， And by me saying。

 fuck this front， you know， someone in this context who has authority and he's going to look up to what I'm saying。

 Just due to the context that I'm giving the event， I rob him of that coping mechanism。

 I make it not cool， I make it so he has to stop putting on this fucking front。

 It's like if you take a people pleaser and you tell that person， stop pleasing all the time。

 stop saying yes， They're saying yes to cope， but now their coping mechanism is gone。

 because I take it away， And that's why I did here， I'm like， stop being James Bond。

 And now he has to put himself out there， and you see the little bit of the clouds parting。

 a little bit of authenticity kick in， So this is something you'll see me do a lot in the following videos too。

 Alright， pause， pause， pause， So I amplify it here。

 we start with the screaming and now it's let's fucking dance。

 I just really will push you outside of your comfort zone and you see him just that resistance kick in。

 He's like， okay， I'll start dancing and he's like， oh my god， oh my god， this is too far out there。

 I can't， I can't， Now the cool thing about this is you hear the crowd like， come on， come on。

 there is no escaping this， You know， for him to back out of this situation now that he's up is more embarrassing。

 let's just say， Like there's more fear than actually going through。

 so you can use the pressure of the crowd here to force him to go through this experience that'll remind him of what it's like to be authentic。

 Now， I love this， alright， now pause， I love it too， it's like， I know it's hard， but look at this。

 it's like， did you see it a couple of times？， It's like， he's there and he's about to。

 like it's inside him， like it wants to come out and he's like， there's nothing missing in you。

 If you're watching this， you're like， man， I don't know if I could be loud， you can。

 You don't need to train yourself to be loud， it's about getting rid of what's in the way， For him。

 there is that loudness， there is that fun personality， you know。

 he just has to get out of his own fucking way， which is what we're making him do here， It's like。

 it's there， and that's what I'm saying， it's very simple to do yet， so hard。

 Because you don't have to do， you just have to like， shut this like， fuck off， you go， fuck off。

 self-concept， let loose， Let's try again， because you're not getting out of here without it。

 it's better just to surrender to it and be like， fuck it， The hardest thing you'll do， fuck it。

 this is why you're cause effort to get there， once you're there， you'll see， once you go， it's like。

 it's no effort， And it's not something you need to do， it's like， I know。

 enjoy the resistance to it， and let's make it happen， So again， he's trying to back out。

 there's no backing out at that point， when you have a huge crowd just cheering you on。

 You're there in front， you're like， fuck， and you just see him， the resistance kicking， he's like。

 no， it's like， he's just fucking there and he has to let go， He has to just get out of his own way。

 there's no backing out， Loose it， loosen it， loosen it， run back and forth， run back and forth。

 loosen it up， crazy， crazy， run， high five people， shit， There， there， there， loose， jump off。

 high five， keep doing it， dance， dance， loose， rock， whatever you feel like do it。

 So it's the pressure of the crowd， but also the support of the crowd， you know， it's like。

 there's the crowd there， you're like， oh my god， I must do it， But then of course， my， hey。

 go run through the crowd， high five people， you start getting people high five and you're like。

 everyone here is on this guy's side， Everyone here wants to see him be authentic。

 and this is something that's crazy to think about too， is we think we must always do right。

 We think， hey， if we go up on stage， and everyone's looking at us。

 they want to see us do the right thing， they want to see us be cool， but that's not true。

 They want here is authenticity， they want to see you be authentic。

 they want to connect with that authentic you， that's what we're all in need of。

 that is what we're all fucking craving， Hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， loose， loose。

 loose， loose， loose， loose， loose， loose， loose， loose， loose， the fuck up， whoo，跳跟踩了， COO！。

靈 zombies 跑光了，爺爵 力了，靈lig，魯武，我講說，唉啦 為何要跳，爺爵uko，LET'S，在這裡，然后这会儿是在，你 sometimes you'll get。

 extremely stifled and bang，for like a full fucking minute， or two，哇，that person is there。

 but oftentimes it's， kind of back and forth，you know it opens a bit， then it closes， it opens a bit。

 and it closes，you know you open a bit， you'll be a little bit loud， and you're like， whoa。

 and then you start judging yourself again，哇， and then you close up， but the goal here。

 again as I mentioned， is， this won't make it permanent， but it will give him that glimpse。

 it will give him， that reminder， and that proof that， you know he can do it， he can be loud。

 it's in him， and nothing bad happened， we saw little glimpses of it， of him just like fucking。

 letting him lose smiling， it's that， is there， covered up by shit， and you're covering it up。

 your entire life， shoving you're subconscious， your entire life， that now it's like。

 you just you've forgotten， that that's really you， and what do we do， we tell ourselves。

 I don't have this， this is me， and I'm going to work on getting it， versus letting it out。

 and until， like as you keep on working on getting it， you're going to keep reinforcing， this is you。

 this is your default， and when as we saw， this is not his default， if that makes sense。

 I hope you're all following this by the way， all right， so， you're good on this one。

 give yourself some props， because as I see right now， you're back in your head， judging yourself。

 yeah， you're good， boss， same for him， same for him， all right， all right， now， now， all right。

 do you want the I still see you， judging yourself， do you want the ultimate experience right now。

 the ultimate， we'll blast the fucking music， as we do this， literally， this is your time。

 this is how you should feel， 24 fucking seven， go， everyone up， go， go。

 so I go all out with this too， I mean I'll make you crowd surf， it's like。

 whatever it fucking takes， so this is a great example， of getting out of your head， you know。

 going through， these different exercises， going through these different experiences。

 that kind of unlock， this authenticity， that's inside， it doesn't get to the cause。

 it doesn't make it permanent， but if you do this， on top of， that inner journey。

 and letting go of the resistance， I mean why not， why not， hit it from both angles。

 and I want to add， another segment here too， because， another thing， that a lot of us。

 just suppress， is singing， you know， it's， being loud， dancing， those are huge， screaming， huge。

 and singing， so， another one， a lot of people have trouble with， is， singing。

 and I have this too for a long time， I remember as a kid， we're all loud， we're all loose。

 we all laugh， we all sing， you learn songs at school， you're singing them all the time， until。

 for me for example， my parents kind of playfully teased me about it， not in a mean way。

 in a fun joking way， but in my mind， I'm like， I can't ever let anyone see， this loose side of me。

 who can sing， you know， if your parents are， you know， every time you're happy， they're like。

 no no no， it's like， that's good， but you know， don't get ahead of yourself， be serious， okay。

 it's good to celebrate， but let's focus on the next thing， and your mind， you're like。

 well it's not loud too， I'm not allowed to celebrate my success， it's always about the hustle。

 it's always about the head down， if you laugh， and people are like， well you know， like they say。

 if that's not funny or don't laugh， you're going to start suppressing， that part of you that laughs。

 I had that too for a long time， I felt， I always thought， like I'd look completely stupid。

 whenever I laughed， I thought it was uncool to laugh， even in a picture， I'm like。

 well what's the cool， pose for a picture， because I can't laugh。

 because I look like a fucking idiot if I laugh， and we just start suppressing it， it's crazy。

 you know， can you sing something？， but why don't you？， I can't， well let's do it now， come on up。

 come on up， come on up， here， but you have to think of me， don't react， don't react。

 usually impulses like that， which I do like， it means it's something， a little bit inside of you。

 that's been suppressing this， for so long， you're like， you'd like kind of project it。

 it's the most thing， you're actually telling that to yourself。

 as you can sense by how tense you are right now， okay， so， what's the song you like？。

 I like a lot of songs but I can't， let's pick one， lyrics， down from， Shanko， you know， no but。

 if you don't， here's the plus side for you， is that this actually gives us some fucking wi-fi， and。

 let me ask you this， you know， we are the champions by Queen。

 if not I'll give you the lyrics right now， all right， now by the way。

 does anyone feel tense just now like， fuck I'm glad I'm not here， raise your hand to be honest。

 yeah， it's pretty fucking crazy， now， anyone feels really tense about this， it's like。

 we all have that， that's like a sign like， you have some shit that's like really shut down there。

 and that's kind of been triggered like， oh my god， like we all have it。

 like if I sing a file at loose， I will be so ridiculed and shamed， and that's what you feel now。

 and your ego's telling you that too， and what are you doing now， it's like I was like。

 really tense but now it's like coming down， well you're going to be tense。

 because I'm being judging you， do it every once in a while， let's see， I'll even plug it in。

 so you get the full on speaker， all right， so you have the lyrics here， when do you upload this。

 you have the lyrics here， stay focused， and here's a song， so you can see also signs of him。

 trying to escape it here， you know I like the first cover， it's like no I can't。

 he's like making these little jokes， like what like this， huh， do you have the。

 do you know the song， what， like this， we're trying to not be so focused。

 again these are just signs， of him trying to escape， but as we discussed before， you're here。

 you're in front of the crowd， I'm there， there is no escaping， you can try as much as you want。

 to avoid this experience， that will unlock some authenticity， it's not going to help， now loud。

 so everyone get here， nope， we got a sing loud， to the crowd， good， keep going， all right。

 everyone has a chorus， all right， we're here， we're here， the champions， orange up， assuming。

 even louder， louder， louder， three out of ten， comes， time for， the， champions， we， are the。

 champions， all the more， on your own， we are the champions again， three out of， champions。

 even louder， assume like that feeling， you had when you were part， of the group， fuck the lyrics。

 you can fuck them up， you have my permission， to fuck up the lyrics， it doesn't have to be perfect。

 we are the champions， my friends， louder， that passion， until the end， we are the champions， louder。

 we are the champions， all time for losers， pause， because we are the champions， now good。

 but you were way louder with the crowd， louder， no you went everyone was singing， you were louder。

 I want you to like tune into that， that feeling when there is no shame， you're part of the group。

 because that's really the way it works， it's like when you do it， and everyone fucking joins in。

 you're like， it's okay， I will not be mocked， I will not be shamed， I can finally let it loose。

 and when you really do it， now it's like you're back to doing， this half-assed。

 you're still trying to be cool when you do it， it's not really a release。

 but you will feel relief after doing it， most of the time， it's like， we're always suppressing。

 so it's like， just think， suppressing， you sing as a kid， it's like， haha， people mock you。

 shove it down， shove it down， you suppress， and then you spend your rest of your life。

 just running away from that， and this is how that little voice fucking kicks in。

 you want to talk about self-acceptance， it's this， until you fully accept， and release。

 and go through an experience， all the stuff you've， suppressed， you're always going to be， escaping。

 and there's always going to be that little voice， where it's like， okay， yeah。

 you succeeded at that， but， we all know， you're not good enough， we know， there's parts of you。

 that you should be embarrassed of， a shame of， that's why we think。

 it's like well I'm not good enough， but then if I really ask you， why are you not good enough。

 a lot of the time we're just like well just cause， like there's no real reason。

 but that's really it， it's going in， to that dark fucking spot， where you just suppress it。

 where you think all this stuff's wrong with you， and it's funny how even positive things。

 could be wrong with you， singing， laughing， something's wrong with you， and guess what。

 that has been running you， your entire life， and your whole， again， paradigm's built on that。

 that assumption， okay， so what we're doing here by the way， is instead of escaping it。

 we're learning to express it， okay， and that's good， it's better than nothing。

 but it's also not fully getting to the cause， okay， expressing。

 is better than just keeping it suppressed， by ideally it's going in， and just fully releasing it。

 so you don't even have to escape， that's true， self-acceptance by the way。

 it's diving into that and realizing， there is nothing wrong with you。

 because until then you're always going to feel like， there's parts of you that are unacceptable。

 and that's why you never feel like you're enough， or complete， you know， and。

 I mean we all have this， and this too it's like， for you it's also kind of taken in like。

 you're not the only one who has this， a lot of fucking people have this。

 yet it's very easy to think we're the only ones， it's just us， it's just， you're minding you。

 you little weirdo， everyone else laughs， everyone else can sing， ah like that。

 like that's what we think， you know， and we think well no one will ever accept me。

 but here it's like， look a lot of people are like you the more personal。

 the more universal the wound， and I can guarantee you to kind of building on this。

 no matter who you are， okay， someone is out there will accept you， no matter， how fucked up you are。

 whatever weird shit you're into， whatever things you're ashamed of， someone will like you。

 yes who's asking like the Derek story， you guys hear that one。

 the most fucked up but most awesome way of explaining this， so basically here's the story。

 this is a true story， there was this guy up in Washington state in America。

 who had a weird fetish of getting fucked by a mule， or a bull， up the ass， a very true story。

 and don't film this part， it was like， so that was his fetish， and he went on Craig's list。

 and he wanted to join people into the fun， so he started inviting all these guys up。

 and they would all meet and just you know like 12 dudes。

 just go up to this farm and I'll get fucked， until one got fucked a little too hard。

 and there was internal bleeding， and he had to go to the hospital and he died。

 to the story and then everyone found out about this， and was like oh my god， now。

 with this beautiful story here， in terms of you and who you are， and all your suppress it。

 and everything you think is bad about you， and not acceptable， if that guy can find 12 other dudes。

 to go get fucked， of you， you can find someone who likes you for you， okay。

 like it's true no matter who you are， like if I came up to say you right now， and I'm like look。

 you have to bet right now， like， are the chances higher， of you finding a girl who likes you。

 and fully accepts you for you， or finding another dude to go get fucked by an animal。

 what's the higher percentage， which one do you bet on， finding someone who likes you for you。

 no matter who you are， yeah we're like no， if she finds out all our dirty little secrets， it's over。

 okay， and we do this with again， like singing， letting loose， we also do this with， you know。

 anxiety， you can still say don't， really， you're not done， you're not done， I just want you to say。

 you don't have to qualify yourself， okay， because you also have this。

 by the way like the more you kind of started digging， deep， there's a fuck ton of resistance。

 what's your experience， do you pray， do you pray， okay not ever no one's out to give you。

 that's another thing to really realize is like， no one's out to give you no one's out to shame you。

 it's not a battle you versus the crowd or you versus me， it's kind of realizing oh no one's here。

 no one's， against each other， and it's not about being cool， it's not about being right。

 it's not about not being wrong， it's not about not looking like an idiot。

 it's about being authentic， and I can guarantee you like， once you let。

 like those little burst of authenticity out， that's what everyone will connect with。

 like no one wants to see some dude， is like， fucking always like perfect and cool。

 it's it's you can sense the fakeness， it's annoying。

 it's like we're all just here like trying to find authenticity。

 and we underestimate the value of authenticity， all the fucking time， like that's what we want。

 if you actually even saw him just like， like totally like voice crack and shit。

 but there's like that realness， it wasn't controlled， it was a little glimpse， of him letting loose。

 that's what I remember to connect with， and love the way fucking more， you know。

 so we are going to do that but yes， so you mean like accepting that you like。

 for example when you sing like， in front of everyone， did you are like not like perfect。

 and you're not like the， as low as possible as you can be， well if you fully accepted that is fine。

 out to be perfect， you would be way louder， and that's another interesting thing。

 is like we're telling ourselves， okay we're not perfect， let's put in effort to be perfect。

 and here's the difference， there's a reason to by the way， I'm able to talk like this。

 like the mic's unplugged right now， and you can probably hear me all the way to the back。

 I'm not forcing shit right now， it's like I'm like， so I'm talking right now。

 really loud so everyone can hear me， so I'm talking right now， really loud， so everyone can hear me。

 it's loose， you want to get really loud， you can't fucking force that shit， it has to be loose。

 and then you'll see it like comes out， and that's why I talk about even like。

 hustle coming from abundance， like we're always putting in so much effort。

 to like hustle hustle hustle， if you're loose， holy shit， can you go way harder and for way longer。

 like right now if I came up on stage， and this still happens by the way。

 there's still that little belief， where it's like， here's the crowd。

 let's fucking win the crowd over， let's do this， and you've seen probably seminars like that。

 where I come up on stage， I'm like， like that， they're good， but， this is the stuff that's a lot。

 loose and more powerful， and this requires no fucking effort， because the other one is like。

 you're battling， it's like you're still trying to be cool， just like Ovidol， and the same as like。

 trusting inspiration will kick in， you got to trust that loudness will fucking kick in。

 so this is really the outer approach， you know， and I combine the two。

 I'll do this and then I'll have them sit down， for example and， go through the process。

 of letting go， but， why not do both。
