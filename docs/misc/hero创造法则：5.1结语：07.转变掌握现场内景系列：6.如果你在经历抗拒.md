# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：6.如果你在经历抗拒

所以， as you previously discussed，， when you turn around and face what it is，。

 you're running away from，， you're going to experience a lot of resistance。， Okay。

 there are going to be a lot of layers of resistance， that you're going to have to blast through。。

 And what I thought we could do here is crack into some segments。

 to really illustrate how resistance will show up， and it can be extremely subtle。。

 And how to go about it so that you just keep going deeper。

 and deeper and deeper into what it is you actually fear，， blasting through those layers，。

 as opposed to just staying stuck on the surface。， Okay， if you follow the trail of whys。

 for example，， let's just say you fear rejection。， Okay， I fear rejection。， Why？。

 And this is a trap I see everyone falling to， where they just stay stuck justifying。

 what they previously said。， I fear rejection。， Why？， Because it doesn't feel good。， Why？。

 Because I got rejected。， Okay， you're staying at the surface，。

 going in circles as opposed to sinking into it。， I fear rejection。， Why？。

 Because it makes me feel like I'm a bad person。， Okay， and why is that scary？， Because if I'm bad，。

 I could be abandoned and end up alone。， I fear being alone。， Okay， and why？。

 Keep on going deeper and deeper and deeper。， So always ask yourself，。

 are you justifying or going deeper？， Another more subtle way resistance will show up。

 is I don't know。， Why？， Just because I don't know。， And by saying that，。

 you immediately block yourself off， from receiving the answer。， Okay， you have to be willing here。。

 You have to be in a state of openness， and always ask yourself，， what is beneath this？。

 Let's just keep sinking into it。， More and more and more。， Due to previous experiences，。

 I'm trying to， to please them and not， and order not to lose them， because I was hurt in the past。。

 And I feel like，， by then， I didn't take the responsibility， and， I didn't do anything against it。。

 And now，， trying to， and not let things go into that way。， So I'm trying to。

 do everything in order to please them。， Yeah， we're getting less open。， That's fine。， Bye。， Okay。。

 I'm trying to。， Nothing。， What happens if you stop pleasing him？。

 So she came to this event with her boyfriend。， This is an Amsterdam。， They live in Germany and she。

 bought him the trip out， to the event for his birthday。， Okay。， In order to， please him。。

 And there's nothing wrong with that。， Of course， you'd want to please your partner。， However，。

 as she's describing it here，， there's a compulsive need to please。， Okay。， So it's not this。

 genuine， coming from a place of inspiration。， It's compulsive coming from a place of desperation。。

 I must always please him。， I must always keep him happy， or else。， Okay。， Or else what？。

 Let's go deeper here。， Okay。， What happens if you stop pleasing him？。

 I don't know what I'm going to do， with myself。， If I would lose him，， it's not about a life thing。。

 Well， let's dive into that。， Let's dive into that。， Say you lose him。， Well， if I stop pleasing him。

， I may lose him。， You know，， okay， well， what happens if you lose him？。

 Deeper and deeper and deeper。， What's so scary about that？， Now what？， First thing that pops in。。

 He's gone。， He's like， it's over。， Falling back into depression。。

 This is where it gets really tough。， It's like that thing you keep running away from。。

 That's the shit you got to dive into。， So as you can see here too，。

 it starts getting more emotional。， You know， it's，， I fear not pleasing him。， Why？。

 Because I fear losing him。， Why？， And more and more keeps coming up。， Okay。

 and this is the stuff that runs you。， This is the stuff you have to face。。

 And it's stuff you don't want to face。， Like notice，， you don't want to go there。。

 And this is why I can also be good to have someone， guide you there。

 and support you and have the support of the group around you。， This is where you got to go。。

 And that's why there's all this resistance covering it up， because you don't fucking want。。

 You know， the pleasing is like，， of course you don't want to please like whoever you with。。

 It's fucking awesome。， Like that's what you should do。， But it's like，。

 if there's always that little need，， it's like you'll never get rid of that little worry。。

 It's like he can be happy。， I mean， you guys look fucking awesome together。， It's like you know，。

 you're both there happy。， You're here。， You brought him here on his fucking birthday。， It's like。

 fuck yeah。， But there's always going to be that one percent of like，， one day， one day。。

 Anything that's out of compulsion， is always running away from that scarcity。。

 That's what I did with success with women。， I'm like，， yeah， I'm getting more girls， more girls。。

 But I'm still running away from， if I stop getting the girls， what am I？。

 If I stop having all these girls love me，， can I love myself？， What'll happen？。

 If me is the same thing， it's like，， oh， fuck， what if I am alone？， You know。

 it's like that we have huge fear，， like some of the comments，， like fear of being alone，。

 fear of abandonment，， fear of being bad，， fear of being wrong，， et cetera， et cetera。。

 And that's where all of our attitudes and behaviors grow。， And that's like the tough part。。

 That's what you got to like dive into。， No matter how traumatic it is。， I started， you know，。

 not seeing myself，， not being the thoughts。， And then it was totally clear for me，， you know。

 and then I just stopped being， from one woman to the other，， and everything was fine。。

 And now I feel myself falling back into this pattern， just because。。。， So what's the pattern？。

 The pattern，， is that probably because back in school，， I didn't have many friends at some point。。

 I must have very unpopular。， And then when things changed and I got friends，， I moved to Germany，。

 and Portugal，， and everything started to be different， because I told myself，， you know， this，。

 leave all of that chip behind，， an important story in New Life，。

 which is just suppressing and so on as well。， And I got so dependent on other people。

 because now that I had friends，， everything was like in their hands， you know？， And，， yeah， no。

 I don't want to fall back into that， if I'm alone again， you know what I mean？。

 Maybe it's not really logical，， but it's kind of irrational fear。， No， it is logical。， It's like。

 we all want approval。， Like， we all lack to approval。， We all felt like we didn't get enough，。

 especially in depending on the environments you were in。， It's like say， you know，。

 you were bullied or like you didn't have many friends。， It's like you crave that approval。。

 But then it's like you start getting it。， It's never enough。， And as soon as you have it，。

 there's that fear of losing it。， You know？， So let's dive into the fear of losing it。。

 What would be like one of the scenarios， where it's like the most painful of losing it。

 or the most painful just being alone？， So again， it's asking that，。

 what would be the worst-case scenario？， What's the worst thing？。

 A great way to just keep going deeper into it。， Do you mean？， Say in Portugal。， Before you move，。

 like the first scenario，， the most， say， the one you just don't want to go， and re-experience。。

 It was probably not just， not having real friends at some point，。

 but it was more like falling for a guy， that at some point just rejected me when things got more serious。

， And I wanted clearance and I wanted， it， you know， something to rely on。。

 And then things just broke up completely。， And。。。， Why did they break up？， How did they break up？。

 I don't know。， At some point，， he just said this，， he didn't want anything serious。。

 And he was probably just feeling like， pushed into a corner and stressed out。， And under pressure？。

 Mm-hmm。， And how did you feel after he left and after he said that？。

 Not worthy of being a relationship， of getting love or。。。， Yeah。

 having people tell me that you're a great one，， that you're worth a receiving one？， Yeah。。

 So going deeper here，， it's not feeling worthy of being loved。， I fear not pleasing him。。

 You can stay there and focus on that，， but that's still surface。， Go deeper。， I fear losing him。。

 I fear not being worthy of being loved。， What else？， Keep going deeper。。

 What happens if you're not worth of receiving love？， Say that's true。， What happens？。

 I probably won't believe that if I tell myself I am worthy，， I really am。， You know？。

 What if you're not worthy？， Why is that bad？， Why do you need to be worthy？， To love myself？。

 To be okay with that and move on with life。， And it's just in the way， you know？。

 It feels like if I cannot accept myself，， I cannot really live in the life I want。。

 And I don't know how to。， So the first thing here is that。

 realize that if you need others to accept you first， in order for you to accept yourself，。

 it will never work。， Okay？， Because it depends on something external。。

 You're not free or bound to the approval and acceptance， of others and it also reinforces。

 you're not good enough to begin with。， You need that acceptance in order to be good enough。

 in order to accept yourself。， So that strategy is flawed。。

 But those sensations right now that she's experiencing，， that's what we have to dive into。。

 That's what we have to release and do the process with。， Okay？， You always have to go deeper。。

 You always have to get to the cause。， Because it's easy to think， you know what？。

 I always feel like there's the need to please， my partner and my relationship。， Let's release that。。

 And that's good。， It's better than ignoring and just putting your head， in the fucking sand。。

 But you got to go deeper to the source， to the roots。， Okay？。

 And you can see how you don't want to go there。， There's that resistance。， And as soon as you do，。

 it starts getting emotional。， There's like， oh my god。， That's what you got to tune into。。

 You've got to release here that fear of not being， worthy of being loved，， of not being accepted。。

 What if that's true？， Let go of that。， I have like really great work， I think。。

 And I'm going to go into the game。， It was like， fuck yeah， I can express myself。。

 This came from a lot of social anxiety。， I couldn't even fucking talk to cashier。， So you know。

 I feel fucking shitty。， And then when I did my first approach，， it was like， fuck yeah。

 it was amazing。， And it keeps sort of riding that wave。， I don't have different hot seats。， Brushes。

 pens， shift。， Like it got me to like an amazing place。， A lot of my social circle。。

 I had a couple of girlfriends that were really really good。。

 So I've been like making money from some promoting。， Right， just bringing some girls to the club。。

 And at some point， I just like stopped。， And the same with relationships。， I was just。

 it was good to a really good point。， Where like the girls amazing。。

 It's just really understanding about the game，， about everything。。

 I was just go cold and wouldn't answer。， Like completely。， And then， um，， so let's dive into that。。

 Because I like this。 That's context。， But it's like， always go deeper。。

 Because it's very easy to like think of an example。， And they're like， oh， and there's also this。。

 And there's this。， And it's just why。， Repicture it。， That one scenario。， Say with that girl，。

 everything's going well。， She's super understanding。， It really likes you。， You go cold。， Why？。

 So what he did here is he identified the pattern。， You know， the pattern of self-subitage。。

 He's like， hey， I've realized that in all these areas of life，， I progress。， But then eventually。

 I just kind of， yeah， give up。， You know， if I get in a relationship。

 and something starts going well，， you eventually just go cold and let it fall apart。， Okay。， Now。

 that's good。， However， one of the ways that resistance will kick in。

 is it'll get you fixated on this pattern。， You know， where you're like， well， I self-subitage here。。

 But I also self-subitage here。， And I also self-subitage here。， And here。， And here。， And here。。

 And here。， Staying on the surface versus sinking into it。， It's like， cool。

 you identified the pattern。， Now， I'll sink into that。， Why？， You know。

 instead of just thinking of more times， and more examples， sink into the why。。

 And don't give me the right answer。， I'm with the real answer。， The first thing that pops up。。

 Because that's what we do。， It's like， the answer actually pops up。， We're like。

 is that okay to say？， No。， What's a good answer that people would approve of？， Fuck the good answer。

， What's the real answer？， Picture。， I think。， The girl loves you。， She's there。， You go cold。， Why？。

 I know it's like， I just love worth it anymore。， It's all not worth it anymore。。

 I just like can't feel it out。， Okay。， Why？， Not accepting off the success is like， you know what？。

 When it comes to like， instead of riding the way the way， for it， I'm like， fuck it all。， Who cares？

， Why？， I don't know， it'd be as。。。， I like to think， well。

 my person take on it is like the whole like，， yeah， it's not worth it。， It's just an excuse。

 but that's not the real reason。， Similar to a lot of guys and interactions， it's like， deserving。。

 I like the feeling of like， I'm not good enough to have it all， and to have all the success。。

 That's a need to work in this and this and this and this。， That's fucked up。。

 That's what that was like， find some reason of， okay，， that's like that area's amazing in my life，。

 but that's not a point。， Yep， that's not a point。， That's not a point。， That's not a point。。

 So notice here too， you know， the resistance， it's not，， it's not worth it， you know。

 it's not worth it， go deeper。， It's because you don't feel deserving of it。。

 That it's not worth it is what's covering the real thing。

 and this sense of deservingness is huge by the way。， When it comes to self-sabotage。

 it's because you don't feel like you deserve it。， And， yeah， I think， and then from that，。

 I would like rationalize not calling the fucking person，。

 not like we should have to know completely。， Yeah， so why are you not deserving？。

 Why are you not deserving your stance，， why are you not deserving？。

 Notice how does that tendency to just keep talking about it，， staying fixated on one level。

 go deeper。， Why are you not deserving？， Let's say on that one example of the girl，。

 why are you not deserving？， Why are you such a piece of shit？， Same question。。

 I don't know why it's just， it's。。。， The honest is the shit。， And it's not beating yourself up。

 it's like it's being true。， Because there is that belief。， If you don't think you're good enough，。

 you think you're a piece of shit。， Why？， Be real for once。， You know your piece of shit。

 let that voice come out。， Don't fake it。， Why are you a piece of shit？。

 And the reason I say piece of shit so much here too， is to really trigger something。。

 I want to bring those sensations out。， Popped。， Popped in， say it。， Whatever pops in。

 why are you a piece of shit？， What comes up when you hear like I'm a piece of shit？。

 So something was triggered here，， you know it's like piece of shit。。

 But then immediately you try to stuff it back down。， And that's how a lot of resistance will work。。

 Something will maybe come up and then immediately you're like， stuff it back， you suppress it again。

， And this is a great benefit of just having me there。

 and this crowd there is I take away that option。， I'm like no， no， no。。

 I side pop up for a fucking milliseconds。， Don't stuff it down， let it out。， Okay。

 again I take away that option of suppressing it again。， I love this thing。

 I like to let down a lot of people， at the past。， Okay， now we're getting somewhere。。

 Who did you let down and how？， Right， this is the process you have to go through。， By the way。

 it's like sitting like this。， I'm like blasting through that resistance。。

 You don't have so much resistance。， Like well， there's this thing in this thing。， It's like deeper。。

 Well， I guess deserving。， Deeper。， Here's like deeper。， I'm not going to remind this one。。

 Aside university。， So I wanted to study one thing which is acting。。

 And it went for an instruction engineer， because of former parents and fucking engineers。。

 So for that。， And our fucking college was hated。， And after half a year， I just quit。。

 But I didn't tell anybody。， I told my student， told my parents that I was still studying。。

 I did you see？， Yeah。， And did the shirt thought that I was still studying？。

 I was just not doing the classes。， Yeah， at that point I was just starting。

 to do anything just sitting at the whole day， like full of fucking computer。。

 I think it will like all the press and show。， And I feel like if my parents， like。

 down so much at the point。， But I know for the point that they have。

 a very different outlook on life than I did。， But still felt like I'll let them down so much。， Yeah。

， Yeah， the outlook is like，， that's you consciously telling yourself that。， Emotionally。

 it doesn't matter if they have a different outlook。。

 There's still you feeling like you let them down。， Who else did you betray？， At the surface。

 there's I sell sabotage。， Going deeper， it's because I don't feel deserving。。

 Going deeper is because you hate yourself， and feel guilty in a way。， Because you betrayed。

 let's just say this example。， Your parents， when you wanted to do something else。

 and you lied to them。， So there's that self-hate and guilt beneath it all。， And of course。

 here I'm like，， let's think into that。， Who else do you betray？， Bring those sensations up。。

 Bring your awareness to that。， Always get to the source。， Get to the cause。， I know myself， I think。

， Like， because what， what， what，， what was your interest in express？， What， what， what， what， what。

 what， what， what， what？， So huge here。， I betrayed myself。， And that's。

 we'll keep that self-hate going。， That'll keep that guilt going。， And that'll keep fueling。。

 That's something not you， not being good enough。， Because you're not good。。

 Because you betrayed yourself。， You don't love yourself。， And of course， you're going to keep。

 you know，， self-hate going。， You're going to keep， you know， self-sabotaging。。

 And you can try to work on the surface。， Like， let's do this to stop self-sabotaging。。

 But until you get to this，， it'll just be surface work。， It'll never be permanent。。

 What do you think about that you at the time who，， you know， didn't tell your parents，。

 didn't follow his passion，， and then just lied straight up to your parents。

 about what you were doing？， No， I felt really shit。， I felt really shit。， I was like。

 a lot of bothered，， I'm emotional。， I couldn't。， Well， look back in time right now。。

 You see that you then，， do you feel happy about that person？， You want to be like dumb cunt？， No。

 no， dumb like dumb cunt。， dumb cunt？， Shut up。， And how can you love yourself？， You hate yourself？。

 No。， No。， No。， It's true。， You know？， This is huge， by the way。。

 It's like this whole like approving yourself。， It's like， we all have it。， Like， for me。

 it was even like going through the media scandal。， It's like， we hate ourselves。。

 And then you carry all this guilt to，， like， they all go hand in hand。， Like。

 we hate ourselves for shit。， We did or shit we didn't do。， And then it's like。

 we just can't get past it。， Like， we think we do。， It's like， oh， it's in the past。， Consciously。

 you know， my parents have a different outlook。， It's totally in the past。。

 But then there's your voice inside， like， bull shit。， You know what you did。， You know， you know。

 you couldn't even stand up for yourself。， Couldn't stand up for your， like。

 what your parents wanted。， Like， you're just going to disappoint the next person。。

 Do you want to fuck over another person？， And because you're a good guy， you're like， no， I don't。。

 It's better to close them off early before I fuck them over， in a big time and before I betray them。

， Yeah， that's， yeah， that's straight。， Do they know now what you want to do？， Yeah。

 where's it still？， They sort of know now， but we don't talk as much as we usually know。。

 There's a big fucking second point。， I need to sort of talk to them more and just， like， you know。

 like， the book record honestly。， It's like， this conversation， so we go back and。。。， I like Redical。

 I see a lot。， However， there's a difference between expressing something。

 and actually processing it。， Expressing wall was help。， You know， it's like verbalizing it。。

 If you're mad， yelling， and shit， like， it kind of takes that pressure off。

 everything that's down there。， But what you got to do is， like， bring that up fully。。

 And very similar to what we were talking about with you yesterday，。

 it's learning to approve of yourself again。， You know？， It's like looking back at that you。

 who you think， like， oh， man，， I've disappointed myself。， I've disappointed my parents。， And， like。

 finally， like， learning how to forgive that you。， So what he has to do here is do the process and let go of all of that resistance。

 around approving of himself。， You know， when you think you must approve of yourself。， Love yourself。

， What sensations of resistance to that come up， tune into those and let go of them。。

 It's always like the relationship we have with ourselves。， Keep that in mind。， It's not you， like。

 disappointing your parents。， It's like， by disappointing your parents。

 then you start hating yourself so and so forth。， And it's like。

 that's the process that fucks you over。， So， it sounds super cheesy。。

 But it's like that's the thing you're left to go。， It's like。

 go through those same events and replay it。， And allow yourself to fully experience that again。。

 And then finally， start approving of yourself。， And usually people will have that。， Like。

 carry on all that guilt。， Again， you own bootcamp。， It's like， you just can't， like。

 you don't let that go。， And anything after that no matter how well you do，。

 you just can't take it in。， And， yeah。， And， well， you never let it in。， Like。

 you can't allow yourself to feel fully happy。， You can't allow yourself to acknowledge your successes。

， And once it gets a little too good， you keep fucking it up。

 because you don't feel like you deserve it。， Because you know， it's like， you know。

 either you'll betray the other person。， And because there's that self-hate， it's like。

 you don't even want。， You're like， I'm not allowed to make it because I fucked that up。。

 I'm not allowed because I'm not a good person。， I'm not allowed because I don't like myself。， Yeah。

 that's true。， That's true。， Yeah， that's it。， The sense that I think this also blocks me like，。

 from fully， like fully voting， like， I haven't cried me in like five years of it。。

 And a lot of shit happened， like， a lot of different stuff happened where， you should cry。

 which like， I'm a lemissar cry。， Why not？， So this can happen sometimes where you start letting something up that's really authentic。

， like， you know， this self-hate， this guilt， and you kind of realize it's okay。， You know。

 it's okay to start bringing some awareness to it and then more things will come up。， Like。

 you know what？， I also have been cried in a long time， you know？， And then， of course。

 you can follow the fear to that。， And this is extremely common to， like， apathy。， Like。

 people aren't able to cry， unable to laugh， unable to feel。， Now， as a little sign-out here， too。

 resistance can manifest itself where， you just bring up more and more things in order to avoid going deep into the first one。

， So， you got to get a feel for it until you're self-hate。。

 Am I honestly bringing stuff up here because， you know， it was okay。

 and I just want to keep on bringing some authenticity out，。

 or am I doing it to avoid diving into it？， So sometimes， I'll cut people off and like， no， no， no。

 stay on the first one，， or， okay， what's going on here？， Let's dive into that as well。， How for me。

 sir， you're a progently。， So， we have to see。， You're a little pussy if you cry。， Yeah， exactly。。

 Yeah， that's like everywhere。， It's like， as man， it's like， if you cry， you're a pussy。， It's like。

 man up。， Are you a pussy？， Man up。， You're like， not okay to cry。， Yeah。

 but I consciously know that， like， this， not sure if this is like，， to feel about some consciously。

 a Silicon fully feeling。， Like， I read， like， a lot of spiritual books and so forth，。

 so I'm okay with， with feeling it， but I still have some precious。

 that don't really have myself feel of。， Why， where's the fear？， What happens if you do？。

 And with Apathy 2， as little signotes，， a trap that's extremely common that people fall into is they view it as good。

， They view it as being the goal。， They view it as them being enlightened。， Because guess what？。

 I never cry。， I'm never sad anymore。， I must be enlightened。， No。

 because there's still that resistance to crying。， Enlightenment， remember， is full self-acceptance。。

 When you are in the state of total non-resistance and you welcome everything。， Apathy is resistance。

， Apathy is numbness。， And I went through a period of this when I was during the medias scandal。

 before I hit rock bottom。， For a period of time， I was just like， you know what？， I'm good now。

 but I was in just total numbness。， And it wasn't good。， You know， that's you lying to yourself。。

 Because things would just keep getting worse and worse and worse。， Until I hit the rock bottom。

 it was， you know what？， Here is fine。 And they just got worse and worse and disappointment after disappointment after a while。

， I was like， you know what？， Fuck it。， And you just kind of give up。， And you think it's， oh。

 I gave up。， But no， that's just you going numb to it。。

 And that's you again abandoning a huge bother yourself。， And the more you do that to。

 the more you realize you're going to start abandoning other emotions，。

 like even happiness to the point where you just don't even fucking feel。， Just full apathy。。

 Not just crying， but just everything。， You're just， you know， a shell of a person。， And， you know。

 that's not alignment。， That's not what you're after。。

 You need to sink into the resistance around feeling。， What's so bad if you cry？。

 What's so bad if you laugh？， What's so bad if you feel？， You know， you're here to feel。。

 Life without feeling is not life。， You're here to have that contrast and that range of experiences。。

 You know， so develop that empathy with yourself。， Like over that resistance。。

 Tune into what comes up when I say feel。， When I say experience negative emotions，， Like over that。

。
