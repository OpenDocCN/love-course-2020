 Completely fulfilled alone，What happens if you， hear me， Never get， Most people are like， No。

 you should feel totally at ease， that doesn't mean don't get a girlfriend。

 Then you get the girlfriend from that space there， That's what you like over all that neediness。

 and shit， For you， it's like you should hustle from， I don't need do this， and then trust yourself。

 that you'll be inspired， for it's， I'm running away，我問你 他一直說，你問有沒有什麼冒險，你以為我穿了風箏，他還沒明白，那他是研究器，不是在告訴你。

Malama's judge like。。。，你 judge me，OK，OK，No， that's good，OK，Yeah， there's a thing。

 high expectations for me， and I have also for myself high expectations，OK， thing。

 I don't want to be stuck like in the middle， you know what I'm saying，OK， I'm maybe not like。

 digging deeper what you mean to say but。。。， Well， take into it now， say you disappoint them。

 picture that， picture you're worse fucking fear， like you disappointing your parents。

 and it like just， the thing they really don't want， you do that， what emotions thoughts like。

 what kicks in， don't judge it， don't give a story just， what kicks in， how do you feel， sad movie。

 something like that， it's， I don't know the anxiety of like， not having made it， how does it feel。

 such an unpleasant feeling， you're in heart， so that's really what he has to， dive into。

 it's directing him to， that， and then of course you can keep on going deeper， and deeper and deeper。

 let's get into another example， yeah， woo， applause， applause， applause， applause， here， go man。

 thank you， applause， applause， applause， applause， applause， it feels like really unreal。

 it's really good， I know， exactly， OK， you can hear my nerves and I think， it's all comes from。

 I have like， like you know the art of accomplishments， I think I can summarize the best。

 from like watching， it was like one RST motivation video， it was like。

 it's like you have to go to the end， and I were at the die if I'm not succeeded， yeah， yeah， OK。

 so that always go go go go， yeah and it's like the same now， like you know， if I don't like perform。

 like to the top at the moment， you know， if you embarrassed yourself in front of this crowd。

 yeah but it's not like the embarrassment， because I don't know。

 even though I feel like really you know， like inside and nervous， I know like I mean you know。

 safe hands， or are you， I don't think it's not so， OK， what are you working on。

 accomplishing right now， like school， relationship， like business， working out。

 like all type of you know， the typical self improvement areas， always trying to maximize it， OK。

 and I know it really comes from you know， a lot of like scarcity。

 and I went through like a you know， minute depression， the spring， coming from like。

 all this and I got stuck in all these mental structures， and even being like a cold shower。

 30 minutes 30 seconds， or one minute longer than the plant， it's just like， you know。

 I just that's downward spiral， like everything， and if I don't like make all my time boxes。

 or going up in like the specific time， it only aspires you know， OK， I like that I like that。

 very like you have compulsive perfectionist， so another self help junkie here。

 and it's really interesting with this， is when you're obsessed with improving in self help。

 is that you do start， having your own best interests at heart。

 you know you do start becoming more healthy， like here's the guys on top of his health， his diets。

 business relationships， like he's doing everything right。

 but it's still coming from the wrong place， you know， it's still compulsive。

 it's that compulsive perfectionist， and he's aware of it， you know， most people are not。

 most people are like， just head bearing in the sand， just continuously obsessive， however he's like。

 hey I realize it， and I realize that， I have this compulsive need to do everything。

 and if I just miss one little thing， it's a downward spiral， you know， and this will happen。

 you'll catch yourself， like， for me， I remember， when I first started getting into health supplements。

 like vitamins， you know， like you know what， well， there's all these benefits， I didn't know of。

 and I started with some basic ones， like you know what， let's just get some vitamin D。

 some fish oil， a multi and some probiotics， but then slowly but surely， you kind of get sucked in。

 and you're like， well， now there's also this， now there's also this， now there's also this。

 this this this， and suddenly， I have this huge， fucking stack of vitamins， and if I just missed one。

 like one vitamin， like am I really going to notice， a huge difference， if one day I just miss one。

 out of all of them， no， but in my mind， I'm like， fuck， the day is fucked， you know。

 so you just keep adding， more and more and more， and now that's like， more to maintain。

 if you just miss one， you're done， you know， with self help， you find out about it。

 and the more you get into， it's like， well I have to do this now， but I also have to do this。

 I have to do this， I have my time boxes， and this， and this， and it just becomes too much。

 and then eventually， you miss it， and it's like a downward spiral from there， okay， so。

 it's the places coming from， be careful not to use， self help， is all these new reasons。

 to beat yourself up， and hate yourself， because you're not living up to them， and， again。

 he's at this peak， of like optimize the paradigm， that's like a sign， you're at the peak by the way。

 and you're at a point， here where you really have to， let go of it， and I'm really aware。

 and I'm trying to work on it， all the time， watching all the videos， meditating a lot。

 but it's just， from the scarcity， because I'm， meditating to accomplish， something all the time。

 and you're running away， from you， disapproving， of yourself， and beating yourself up， yeah。

 that's that's interesting， like you will， this will happen like， when you first find out。

 about for example， being， meditating， or being present， to the moment， or being。

 knowing the higher state of consciousness， every time you're not， you feel like， shit， no。

 I'm not present， to the moment， you know， or hey， be productive， what happens， if you， relax a bit。

 just watch a movie， I'm slacking off， you know， I had that， when I actually first started， touring。

 I， it was when the first， no I've been touring a bit before， but I remember， specifically。

 there was this movie， the Avengers， the first one that ever came up， I was in Austin， Texas。

 with Owen， and he's like， you know， it's pretty good， you seem to， wound up， just go relax。

 watch a movie， and yet I was at the， movie and I just， couldn't enjoy it， I hated， every fucking。

 second of that movie， because I'd be sitting， there and I'm like， I'm wasting two hours。

 where I could be， productive， I could be productive， and you just like， can't slow。

 it's like you're just， hooked on it， so， you know， the obvious question here， is， what happens。

 if you just， don't， like what's so bad， about not being perfect， what's so bad。

 about waking up late， what's so bad， about not being successful， what if I now， every thing。

 you're trying to accomplish， you fail， what comes up， like visualize it。

 everything you're trying to accomplish， you just fail， it just feels like， I would live。

 like a lesser life， in the end， who would you just point， I think， myself， but also like。

 the surrounding， I really want to， you know， live up to， like all the， society's， expectations， and。

 I don't know， like the Renaissance man， or whatever， you know， why， because you get this， mental。

 from the， self-improvement， conditioning， like， the optimal life， is when you。

 achieve all those stuff， mm-hmm， what if it's the opposite， yeah， I know， it is the opposite。

 and that's the thing， you know， but it's so hard to， yeah， let go or whatever， so this example here。

 again， he's aware of it， he knows it， he mentally， consciously knows it， however。

 what he needs to do here， is， actually， do the fucking process， consciously knowing about it。

 is better than not knowing about it， but it won't really change shit， you know， you need to。

 dive into it， let it go， okay， go through the experience， and of course。

 dive into your subconscious， and let go of that， until you do， nothing will change， so for you。

 it's， what I'd recommend doing， because， I was very fucking similar， like I was like。

 hustle a hundred percent， anyone who doesn't hustle， a little fucking pussy， a little bitch。

 you better hustle all the time， she'll the fuck up， through excuses， like， boom like that， and。

 you know， another easy， like another way， we kind of rationalize this， by the way is。

 by taking on the pain， and taking on the suffering， and kind of you， in ourselves。

 is like the martyr hero， I did that， like I was traveling around， like， same on my first tour。

 when I was like， like， workaholic， like， I worked myself， into the fucking ground， and I remember。

 like， this is how I'm not， actually， so was， I was lying， in bed， one morning， and， Montreal。

 and there's this clip， from Breaking Bad， where there's this one scene， where he says， you know。

 I'm not in the， was it money business， I'm in the， empire business， something like that， I was like。

 that's epic， you asked me， if I was in the， meth business， or the money business， neither。

 I'm in the empire business， I literally， like was lying in bed， for like two hours straight。

 replaying those like 30 seconds， and I'm like， yes， I'll take the pain， I'll take the travel。

 I'll take the workload， I don't care， I'm the fucking， like， I'll take it。

 because I'm the fucking hero， in this， like I'm the martyr， I'm like， Jesus on the cross， type shit。

 you know， and it's very easy to take that， it's like， yeah， your perfectionist， like for anyone。

 it's like， always workaholic， or striving， it's like， you kind of take pride， in the fact。

 you're torturing yourself， and hustling， that's what gives you， significance， you know。

 and then you feel like， oh， if I don't take the pain， then what am I， if I don't hustle， what am I。

 so， it's kind of being aware， of it， which you are， and what I'd say now is， um。

 really reflecting on， and just， diving into， whatever comes up， when you ask yourself， like。

 what happens if I don't， if right now， like say tomorrow， you wake up， and I'm like， don't。

 I'm assuming you heard the gym， right， I'm like， don't go to the gym， don't go to the gym。

 eat this shitty food， does guilt kick in， what kick， it's like， drum， whatever sensations， pop up。

 it's tuning into that， so give yourself a little， challenge， like next time， you really feel like。

 oh， I need to do this， give yourself a challenge， and simply don't do it， not all the time。

 obviously， like what you did here， is like， you've really optimized， that paradigm， you know。

 it's like you're working， so hard， towards optimizing， that paradigm， and you want to give。

 yourself a little， couple glimpses， like what happens， if I don't， and it's not simply。

 just not doing it， it's being aware， of what comes up， being aware of the， different excuses。

 being aware of the， different emotions， sensations， feelings， tune into that， and start releasing。

 them， start breathing， through them， similar to what we did here， misery is the first， teacher。

 don't let it be the last， you know， it's like you've used， they're probably， like what to get。

 that jump start， but as you see now， it's very limiting， and it's not sustainable， in the long run。

 like anyone， who's like on this， route of like， like obsessive， like that， eventually。

 will fucking crash， and it's really， interesting， but it could， because it wasn't， really until。

 I got together， with my girlfriend， then I really noticed it， like， you know， because when you're。

 living alone， it's really easy to just， if you have like， bad emotions， or whatever， you just。

 to grab another book， or just hustle even more， but when you have， like a girlfriend， and she wants。

 you know， to watch the fucking， movie or something， it's， you know， you don't really。

 only affect yourself， but you， affect her as well， and she can really， feel like， clearly energy。

 and you know， I think， brought that out， that's interesting， so it's the， all comes to the surface。

 because you can't， really， a suppressive， like another productivity， or whatever， yeah。

 that that's for you， something in me， where I actually， so it's talking about， that first tour。

 I was doing this， on， towards the end of that， first tour， it wasn't a girl， but it was a guy。

 sorry， traveling with me， my buddy does， like a lot of marketing， and I remember， specifically。

 it was right， after the， pimple launch， and if you guys， see pimple， my product， yeah。

 so I launched pimple， and I was like， I like through the， ground to do that， she was insane。

 like I'd be like， running bootcamp， to like three， sleeping till six， like three hours， and editing。

 all， it was just， horrible， but got that done， and， we were in Miami， and Owen and I， are both very。

 just like， hustle， like take action， hustle， and at the time， we were like even more， you know。

 it's like now， I don't know if you've， been aware of， we've been bringing， a lot more of this。

 art of enjoyment， into our videos， like it doesn't， take away， from the hustle， we hustle。

 harder now， than ever， because it's coming， from the right place， but at the time。

 we were just like， like head down， and I remember my buddy， saying it's like， dude。

 let's take a night out， just， fuck around， let's take a night out， just go out， and enjoy ourselves。

 and we'd go out， and even when， going out， I'm like， well let's go talk to girls， and it's like， no。

 dude， let's even do a night， where you just， don't talk to girls， and just fucking， vibe， you know。

 and I was like， ah， there's like， we said， like I must open， like that， and you see like girls walk。

 but it's like I must open， it's like no， dude， like slow it down， and enjoy it。

 and then I'd be there， and I'm thinking of the future， like how long， until I can do an open。

 and hustle， like that， and he even said， he's like， dude， it's like， you're going so far down。

 this hustle route， that you're losing， the ability to even connect， with people around you。

 and this is huge， you know， the more of a， perfectionist you are， you think you're going to be。

 perfect， if you will， you lose， what makes you perfect， trying to be perfect， by doing so， you lose。

 what makes you perfect， by default， you know， you think， it's productive， you think it'll help。

 but in reality， you'll lose touch， with who you are， you'll hate yourself， and you'll lose touch。

 with people， and the world around you， okay， this is not the way， that's not how you get there。

 and that's like， advice for anyone， is like super， workaholic， like head down hustle， it's like。

 if you were actually just， more aware， of the people around you， and more friendly and social。

 they're going to take， you know， you're going to be， tough， if you're， not a good fit， if you're。

 and a good fit， if you're， a good fit， if you're， a good fit， because， you're having your head。

 down with the hustle， hustle， hustle， hustle， hustle， hustle， hustle， hustle， you're cultivating。

 this really， like， anxious， in a way， negative vibe， that repels a lot of people， and your head。

 so far down， that you're， blocking off all this， opportunity，我们的来自的，心能搞成最后一个，文学医业倍，我不一定要 的时候，虑名跟。
