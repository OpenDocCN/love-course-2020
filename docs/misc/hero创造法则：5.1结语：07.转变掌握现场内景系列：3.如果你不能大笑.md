# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：3.如果你不能大笑

所以， is，OK， as we previously discussed，if you grew up in a household where。

 everyone's just negative and miserable at the time。

 if you come into the household and you just start， being positive， start laughing。

 having fun shooting the shit， they're going to quickly shut you down， you know。

 they're gonna be like， hey， not under this fucking roof， you don't be so fucking happy。

 what are you so happy about？， you don't deserve to be happy， and in order to cope with that。

 you're gonna try to disown that aspect of you， the last that is positive， that is happy。

 they're like， oh， this is bad， must always be negative， and this is becoming more and more apparent。

 if you just jump on social media now， and it's reinforced now too， with the whole hustle mentality。

 you know， where there's this whole label around fun， and laughter where it's a waste of time。

 you know， you'll see people make fun of it， it's like， hey， while other people， are laughing。

 having fun， you know， being positive， they're wasting time and that's your opportunity to work。

 and beat them， while they're having fun， you are working， you are always working。

 while they're being happy， you are miserable， and that's what motivates you to work even more。

 hustle， hustle， like that's the hustle mentality， you'll see a bunch of people promoting misery。

 saying it's all about misery， if you're too happy， you better find a way to make yourself miserable。

 to hustle more， and it's the mocking other people who are having fun。

 so it's just reinforcing that conditioning， where you're like， oh my god， it must never have fun。

 you feel guilty about having fun， you feel guilty about laughing， you think you're sacking off。

 you think you're part of the people who are not getting ahead， because they're having fun。

 so that's， you know， happening， and another thing too nowadays， is the whole PC mentality。

 where you're afraid of laughing， because you may laugh at something。

 that in a certain context is not acceptable， and you quickly get shamed for it， like， oh。

 that is not politically correct， you can laugh at that joke， bruh， shamed。

 so it's now scary to laugh， and lessenless people are laughing， I see it in seminars too， again。

 I'll make a joke， and even just like say seven years ago， people were fucking like。

 fall on the floor， like laughing at that joke， here there's always a little bit of hesitation。

 they look around， they say， okay， they'll have， they wait for someone to kind of laugh first。

 and they're like， okay， we can laugh， it's acceptable here， and a lot of people。

 even though other people are laughing， they just can't， there's like， you know， and of course。

 if I see that， you're coming up front， but realize here， as we discussed， again， laughing。

 is a huge sign of thriving， you're not thriving， if you're not laughing， if you're miserable。

 you are not， quote unquote， succeeding， okay， and this doesn't take away， from the work。

 it doesn't take away from hard work， for a lot of things， you want to accomplish。

 you must put in a lot of fucking work， but laugh while working， you know， like。

 I get this question too， it's like， I'm working at a computer， at a desk all the time。

 how can I be positive and laugh， change the inner dialogue， instead of being， like。

 miserable working， start laughing， as you type a word， be like， fuck yeah， look at that word。

 kill in it， look at me， type in this fucking word， thrive， laugh， while， putting in the hard work。

 okay， they're not exclusive， and while you're putting in this hard work too。

 just be more light about it， you know， the same goes for， what we're， you know， talking about here。

 I'll see questions online， you know， taking this shit， so seriously， it's such a perfectionist way。

 and it doesn't mean， this is not a serious matter， of course not， but you can't go about it。

 in such a serious way， you know， I'll see questions like， what's the best way to let go， what is。

 what about this， am I doing it right， is it perfect， perfectionist， I need everything。

 I need to read all the more， knowledge and books about this， oh my god， and just freaking out。

 you know， becoming， very compulsive with this practice， and using it as again。

 another reason to beat themselves up， and you need to， although it's serious。

 you can't be viewing it so seriously， you need to let go of this label， of everything is so serious。

 I must do it perfectly， fuck that， okay， for you to do it perfectly。

 let go of trying to do it perfectly， and this applies to， what we're talking about here。

 it applies to work， and it applies to life， you know， we make things way more serious。

 than they are， we make life way more serious， than it is， you know， don't take shit。

 so fucking seriously， there's a lot of fear， around fucking around， similar to。

 kind of letting loose and screaming， and that's pretty interesting， like we think， you know。

 screaming， or being loud is scarier， in reality a lot of it's having fun。

 a lot of people just can't have fun， they're afraid of having fun， they're afraid of laughing。

 like sometimes if they watch a movie， there's like， they just can't laugh， used to be me。

 I go to even like a comedy show， like let me know if you're like， you go to see a comedian。

 or watch it here， you know， you don't have to meet， like Netflix， you know， watch。

 good comedians on Netflix， do you laugh， are you on your head serious， a lot of us were just。

 in our head conceptualizing， I'd be analyzing， like I see what he did here， I understand the jo-。

 oh， the tonality， yes， I see， first is just actually laughing。

 and you can see the connection here too， to getting out of your head， you know。

 as long as you're in your head， conceptualizing， it's gonna be very hard to laugh。

 it's get out of your head， occupy your body， connect with your body， connect with the world。

 and let that out， you know， it seems so simple， like we just have fun man。

 but it's actually extremely， extremely difficult， and the first thing。

 I want to just get out of your head here， is that you know，， somehow。

 just the way that we're conditioned， we always associate success， in whatever area of life。

 success equals hustle， discipline，， seriousness， grind， torture，， martyr， pain， misery。

 and zero happiness， if you laugh， if you celebrate， if you're happy， you're no longer， what？。

 hustling， yes， you're no longer hustling， you'll lose your drive， you don't deserve it， you know，。

 and we take pride in that， like that's the image we have， so when you are hustling。

 you're actually happy， because you're like， yes， I'm the hustler， you know， it's like。

 you I'll see so many， like， that you have to understand， too there's different paradigms。

 like for someone who's lazy， a shit you better hustle， you know， that's like。

 what I call optimizing paradigm one， but then you got to move beyond that， and right now。

 too many of us are stuck， in this like optimized paradigm one， like you go on fucking Instagram。

 you'll see pictures， of just people looking so miserable， saying， hustle。

 and I'm like what the fuck is that， like literally like the saddest looking people， hustle。

 and being happy about how sad they are， and trying to look sadder than the next person， hustle。

 almost hurting more， let me just hustle， hustle， like that's the next step， you're gonna see that。

 like punch me， hustle， okay， now， it is horrible， okay， that is absolutely horrible。

 I do just want to say though， again， there's different pieces of advice， for wherever you're at。

 with the laughter， with the fun， we have to realize is that， if you're just hooked on this hustle。

 and you're so miserable， you're not winning， that's not the end goal， it's a stepping stone there。

 but to the end goal， and anyone who's quote unquote successful。

 whatever your definition of success is， is not that fucking serious， is not that miserable， okay。

 that is not what it is， if you look behind the scenes， like， if you look at me。

 I'm joking around all the fucking time， behind the scenes， apart from the seriousness。

 before the event， if you look at Owen， Tyler and some of his recent events。

 he's always joking around too， that's a sign of thriving， like you're trying to thrive， is thriving。

 hustle， no， that's not thriving at all， you know， it's okay to laugh， and another one too is。

 realize you will be motivated， by having fun， you will be motivated by abundance。

 it's not just fucking misery， that motivates you， and with a lot of people。

 are just constantly hooked on hustle， in reality， you don't have that self trust。

 you'll be naturally motivated， you don't think that you have， your own best interests at heart。

 you think that if you don't force yourself， to do something， you're just going to go down。

 so there's zero self trust， and because that you're always like， there's always that tension inside。

 so， with you， give us some context， what， why are you so serious， and why why what's up。

 I don't know， it's really weird， I feel sometimes when I have too much fun。

 like party and then I get girls and everything， how do you have fun。

 I just get in state by approaching， how do you have fun right now here， I don't know， try。

 how do you define how， well what's blocking you from having fun right now， you're really done。

 you're really done， I can tell you like， if I was in your place right now。

 what the first thing that would pop to mind， what's blocking me。

 sitting in front of 300 people being put on the spot by me， do you don't think that's blocking you。

 having all this pressure， and people looking at you， judging you from having fun， that's my first。

 so why do you say it， I didn't think about it， okay so that's blocking you what else。

 just dig inside what's going on， I think I'm blocking myself， okay how do you feel right now。

 but everyone's expecting something， but I don't know what the fuck they're doing， hi。

 now one exercise I love doing to people in front， is for like 30 seconds。

 narrate and try to go a little louder here， what's going on， your narrate your thoughts。

 narrate what's going on， present to the moment narrate， so again we have to get him out of his head。

 you know it's like what's blocking you， the fact you're in your head。

 you're like oh my god I must laugh， just that I must laugh now。

 and that's why kind of like adding this pressure， it makes you realize like oh my god。

 my head's blocking me， and another great exercise to get out of your head。

 to kill that front if you will， is to narrate what's going on in the moment。

 you know that little voice that little chatterbox， like what's going on。

 oh my god people are staring at me， I'm supposed to laugh and not be able to laugh。

 oh I'm on stage and Julian's here， and everyone's oh my god， that voice narrated。

 you know by narrating it in the moment， not telling a story narrating what the fuck it's saying。

 you kind of get rid of that front， you know it brings out a little， glimpse of authenticity。

 which will then allow you to laugh， because as long as that front is still there。

 you're trying to maintain a certain image， it'll be impossible to laugh， okay so I'm sitting here。

 just I feel a bit tired， a bit okay， keep narrating， I feel a bit tired。

 wait you don't want to narrate like your mind， and say what the fuck is going to do with the chair。

 that's what you narrate， it's like right now in the moment， when I do this。

 be like whoa I don't know what was happening， and now I'm talking I'm front of all these people。

 and shit I don't really know what's good， here I am with this dude and fucking weird you know。

 please， like that， narrate to the moment， not a story narrate exactly that little voice in your head。

 this is like step one to removing all fronts， because having fun， it's very similar it's like。

 people are people pleasing like anxiety， it's the same type of thing。

 it's like let go of whatever front， you're carrying right now， and step one。

 and this is again not the end goal， it's a temporary step there。

 just narrate what the fuck's going on， so try 10 seconds even， okay so I'm sitting here。

 this guy is looking at me， I think you're good， okay， be careful not to go into。

 story like what your mind's thinking， like right now when you said that。

 and say people started laughing， what did your mind say， narrate that， yeah I felt a bit relieved。

 because okay everyone's laughing now， I can also just let go a little bit， and then， okay。

 they're still expecting something， seriously no thought， no thought about this。

 okay now Julian is touching me， trying to take a picture of her， okay now I feel like I'll go back。

 I don't stuck here， okay， hi， you're laughing， you're gay you're laughing， that's what I'm saying。

 I'm kidding， no no no it's not it's not over yet， it's not over yet， hi now。

 let's just break this down， okay it's like basically， you reached a point like。

 we all hang on a certain image， where I want to do well， we all want to be cool。

 with me here doing this shit， you reached a point， where you just can't be cool no more。

 with some dude massaging your shoulder， touching himself， licking himself， like you can't be like。

 so cool bro， there's no way， you can sit here， and be cool in that scenario。

 and that's when laughter kicked in， so as I mentioned before。

 it's robbing him of his coping mechanism， you know trying to be cool， not laugh， that's you coping。

 if I rob you of that， laughter kicks in， authenticity kicks in， fuck trying to be cool。

 okay this whole trying to be cool， is not cool， when you hear， be a cool person。

 a cool person doesn't give a fuck about being cool， and it links what we talked about before。

 you know the serious person， always disciplined， fuck that， the cool person， always serious， no。

 cool people don't give a shit， the guys who are the coolest， are the guys who are the most relaxed。

 we're just like， yeah just don't care， the people who can feel， okay around。

 the guys who are carefree， it's not someone who's like， hello man， I'm very serious。

 it's like I lose， you know and you can feel it， like an event like this too， and I've done events。

 a lot of events， where I try to be fucking cool， there's a very different vibe。

 there's a different vibe， with me going up here like， okay everyone， do it like super serious。

 there's like a little bit of a， tenseness， versus I fuck it， let's have fun， we're all here。

 let's fuck it like lose， you know， and a lot of that， is destroy your fucking image。

 destroy that ego， you know， and you don't have to do obnoxious things。

 like people read in that way too far， like， oh let me like piss on the ground， destroy like no。

 but just do little things， like just laugh， it's like what can I do， like what am I hanging on to。

 if I let loose， what am I afraid of losing， and then destroy that， and the best way is like。

 learning how to laugh at yourself， like take yourself way， less seriously。

 you know here we're all think， like oh it's so serious， it's like no nothing's fucking serious。

 you know， do shit like that， it's like whatever like you think， like for you might be doing。

 like little gay thing， you know it's like， don't get hooked on that。

 and it'll become the guy who does the gay thing， but little things like that。

 like stuff that sparks up， that genuine laughter， and understand this too， like。

 getting yourself to laugh， like there's no logical thing to do。

 because if you're thinking logically， it's not going to work， because now you're logical。

 it's doing something that disrupts， that logicality， doing something that disrupts。

 your ego for example， something that's out of left field， something that's kind of unexpected。

 so you interrupt your thoughts， yeah， it's like you're like， oh I'm very serious， I'm talking。

 I'm here in front of the audience， something like that， it's like you know expect， you're like。

 you laugh， that glimps of looseness， alright， so， make yourself laugh， what do you feel like doing。

 it's like we're chill， we're all just fucking around， you know it's like there's 300 people。

 staring at you， you're not about to help， saying， yeah one last thing to do。

 just whatever you feel like doing， here you are， well make this fun， you're sitting here。

 you're stuck here for like 15 more seconds， well make the 15 seconds fucking fun。

 so I put the pressure back on him here， you know， everyone staring at you。

 to really get him to do it， on his own， alright everyone， this is Tyler from RST， there you go， now。

 do you feel better， this is just like a little 5 minute example， do you feel better than before。

 yeah， yeah， but， alright， now this， brings up the last point with fun。

 it's like learning how to give yourself props， as well， okay， somehow we have this。

 distorted view where we get so hooked on again like， misery， and you can't give yourself props。

 I see this with clients all the time， I'll give you two quick stories， in Chicago。

 this is linked to successful women， goes out on the first night of boot camp。

 and at the end he's like， he stays with this girl as a drinks one。

 so forth and the next day ask him， so what happened， he's like， well， we stayed there for a while。

 and then I asked her， she wanted to come hang out， and she said no， and I'm like okay。

 so then I texted her today and we met up during the day， and we had a blast and I fucked her。

 and I said no， we were all sitting， why is saying the story， we're in a restaurant。

 some girl walks up from her fucking table， interrupts like excuse me。

 I'm like what the fuck is this， and she's like， she tells the dude， I saw you and。

 can I just have your number， and he's like， okay I guess， and we're all out。

 having a blast at the end of the night， she's like， if someone died， he's like at a funeral。

 and then I fucked her the next day， and then another guy， this is two weeks ago in Stockholm。

 same thing， first night goes out， boom go some with a girl， awesome night next day。

 the first night was pretty good， well what is amazing， if you could see your face here。

 just laughing with the Tyler thing， you're like， talking to for example girls。

 and they can't see the girls smiling back at them， I live to take my fucking phone and be like。

 kshh， run away， it's like who the fuck says， oh fucking we are know like every time。

 they're smiling， take it in， you know， so it's like take in like success。

 we always place this bar way too high no matter what we do， we think no but there's better。

 there's better constantly beating ourselves up， it's like no， like three things where I appear。

 whether you're out interacting with women or in life， it's like one， it's all good。

 like literally whatever you're happening tonight， like oh I fucking just like， it's all good。

 to realize you're there， you've made it， a lot of interactions for example。

 it's guys realizing they haven't made it， it's like you think there's somehow you need more。

 and you just keep chasing， and then you just turn into a try hard。

 a lot of those girls you think you haven't hooked you've hooked， you just haven't realized it。

 you're not hooked but you're not acting accordingly， and three it's give yourself fucking props。

 you know even here the fact that you're still somewhat。

 negative beating yourself up when you used to have fucking。

 a mate like you went up in front of this crowd， most people like a lot of people here。

 would be shitting their pants， or would probably say no and miss out on this opportunity。

 you didn't you stepped up， and you were able to fucking laugh。

 I want to do it when I feel down this shit， yeah well didn't you feel down before you looked miserable。

 is shit you know， and notice how you're still avoiding it like。

 no it's like no at some point you got to sit the fuck down。

 and you should ideally do this every day， and like give yourself props。

 like were you looking for this event， yeah where you don't look like it。

 here you are in front you killed it， you're here with me I'm like dude you fucking awesome。

 and you can't take it in， if this was me like if this was me， like ten years ago even like。

 say I go to a Tyler event and this was me with Tyler。

 I'd be like when he did this I'd be lickin the finger， that's how psyched out be。

 I'd be lickin that finger like there was no end to it， no end to it I just like。

 I got that's what I wouldn't even talk about， shut the fuck up let me lick the finger。

 that's all I would do take it in， and it requires effort to take it in too。

 because there's so much charge around like negative shit， like every time you fuck up it's like。

 oh I suck and people tell you suck， when you do well it's just assumed。

 where's the party when you do well， you know at the end of every single time you go out。

 at the end of every day sit down and be like， fuck what did I do well reflect on it take it in。

 you know you don't have to always be like， you should be lickin the finger。

 stand up and give yourself a fucking round of applause man come on， okay， now this is key again。

 it's like hooked on this negative cycle， and we think it's going to get us somewhere。

 it'll get you off your ass in the beginning， but it won't keep you going。

 you want to keep going into the long term， create a cycle of positivity create a cycle of you。

 giving yourself props so you're going to give up very fucking fast， so I want to emphasize this too。

 if you're someone who has trouble laughing， you know trouble giving themselves props。

 make this a habit at the end of every day， write down your successes。

 you know don't fall asleep just replaying all the failures， oh I fucked this up today this up。

 I'm probably going to fuck this up tomorrow， oh there's this thing I'm going to do。

 oh fuck fuck fuck what did you do well， what did you do well today， and lower the bar。

 give yourself props on hey you know I woke up today， and I brushed my teeth。

 I brushed my teeth well fuck yeah that was a success， you know I woke up today that was a success。

 I'm watching this video that's a success， what are your successes， and if you have trouble。

 there's the warning sign make it a habit， again this is not， we won't make it permanent but why not。

 hit it from both angles again， this is the external approach。

 the outer approach to make this permanent， it's really sitting down。

 letting go of all that resistance， letting go of all the trauma， that made you。

 suppress it in the first place， and another thing too， with laughing is。

 get rid of that image that it's immature， laughing is like for kids， bring that back。

 that's where a lot of creativity， comes from just change the label， from immature to creative。

 of course a good work ethic， add that creativity add that passion， that's where missing。

 you know a lot of people， they have this miserable work ethic， that's coming from compulsion。

 desperation which you should let go of， but beyond that too it's， we're losing touch with this。

 creative side of things， returning into these， miserable robots， and lastly too with laughing。

 realize it's the ultimate form， of self forgiveness， actually laugh at yourself。

 that's when you've truly， you know forgiving yourself， because otherwise it's all these。

 suppress things you just take way too seriously， and you know a lot of people just get triggered。

 and have these pain-body attacks all the time， when you're able to genuinely laugh。

 at all that's it just shows you've， released all of that charge， and I mean it's a sign of。

 just total self acceptance， okay so， this is orgasm， relax your focus， when you are alive。

 and keep relax， your fibers， don't forget， relax your Brain， don't forget。

 enjoy the rest of your creativity。
