# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：4.如果你有社交焦虑

太好了，ament，靈靈，餘下，爭議，偷點， plein點，禿點，在你気檢，我的濓ılar，領，我們又要 Durante，我們至身 Ende，如果她怎樣，枉為問題，我也不怕的話，吃很多的東西。

連我的小孩子，就在此，那 first，跟我講說， 有些人在身上，警方接触，打個字，我 came up on here and I was a fuckin natural。

 rocked it the first time， So first of all welcome up and， You know， Turn to the crowd and like。

 first thing I'd say is just take it in like everyone's staring at you。

 And let's tap into that same authenticity， What's the what's the interdialogue？。

 So I make a really take it in， you know， It's like I want those sensations at the fuckin surface。

 You know， I don't want a little bit of， I'm a little scared， It's look at the fuckin crowd。

 You're here in front， Take it in， Let those sensations arise。

 And let's start by destroying this front， You know， start narrating what's going on。

 Right now I'm really nervous， Okay， Try to ask yourself why， What emotions。

 what sensations pop up you're looking？， It's like not only is it a huge crowd。

 It's like there's also a lot of guys mainly， So it's like holy shit， I mean by the way there's。

 Who here is scared to chill this up public speaking。

 Or speaking in front of crowds or even in school growing up， Bullshit， it's all of you。

 Everyone's fucking scared to chill this event， So let's kind of figure out like internally what's going on。

 What's kind of like brought up emotionally， What are the fears， And then we'll kind of work on it。

 But for now just kind of narrate it， So like you're looking around like narrate the thoughts。

 Narrate the sensations， It's not really， I don't know。

 I don't really care if people looking at me right now， It's just I'm really stressed out。

 And I'm not really sure， Why？ Why are you stressed？， Yeah， that's the problem I think， Yeah。

 what are you afraid of people seeing？， What are you afraid you'll do？。

 What are you afraid you won't do？， Actually I'm afraid I will come off as a really nervous。

 That's something I would。。。， Yeah， that's something I would rather。。。， Sorry， not do。

 I'm stuttering a lot， Good， What would be so bad if you came off as nervous？， I don't know。

 it shows weakness I think， It's scary， So again， what we're doing here is we're diving into the fear。

 Whatever it is you fear follow the trail of why， It's like oh my god I'm anxious， I'm anxious。

 I'm scared， Why？， Let it come up and let's just sink into it， Why？， It's like well。

 I'm afraid of just being very nervous， What's so bad if you're nervous right now in front of the crowd。

 Just going deeper and deeper and deeper， Now， I'll just pause you， really really good。

 Notice same thing， nervousness， It's like whatever it kicks in， we're all nervous at times， Yet。

 what happens？， Nervous equals bad， Nervous equals weakness， If people see weakness。

 what does that say about me？， Never okay to feel nervous， No？， It's true。

 we're always trying to hide like feeling nervous， Yet it's funny。

 it's like kind of linking it with you， It's like if there's actually like authentic like， Oh yeah。

 I'm fucking nervous， we'd love that way more than someone's like， Trying to be cool。

 we all try to be cool and everyone's telling you， Hide that， no， no， anyone see。

 If they see the nervousness， what will they think of me？， You know？， What else？。

 Or even after saying this， narrate， keep narrating， Let's go from now。

 it's really good speaking English， But now I'm not because it's not my first language， And it's。。。。

 It's horrible， there's stutter， the English is bad， Yeah， Luckily， I'm on my mid-length right now。

 I'm not sure what to say， What would be the worst case scenario of you coming up here on Sage？， For。

。。， Don't describe， just。。。， First thing pops in your mind， worst case。

 This is a great question to ask， okay， what would be the worst case scenario？。

 It really makes you bring your awareness to sinking deeper and deeper， you know。

 what's the worst case scenario？， And don't give me the logical answer， give me really what pops up。

 like sink into that there， And as little sign out here too， when I'm making fun of， you know， yeah。

 they're stuttering， you know， you're English， blah blah blah。

 I'm making fun of it to kill that front once again that's trying to be cool， okay。

 and robbing her of her coping mechanism， Shaking？， Okay， what else？ Like， picture it。

 like the worst case scenario， see you came up here and everything you feared came true。

 what happened？， I'm sorry， actually， Well， no， that's logically， Yeah， Like。

 here it's like about being honest， like， similar to， say me learning success with women。

 it's like logically if you're like， you know， why are you so scared to go talk to her？， I'm like。

 well， there's no reason， but if I was actually honest， I'm like， well， if I say hi to her。

 everyone will notice， And the fucking dudes are gonna come beat me up and they're gonna break a bottle on the bar and just stab me to death。

 That's how I feel， you know， so it's like worst case scenario， like painted。

 no matter how unrealistic it is， Well， people would laugh at me， okay， I wouldn't know what to say。

 I wouldn't remember what I wanted to say， And then I'm just like， I don't know what to say， Good。

 good， Keep going， what's going on？， It's basically this， just not knowing what to say， shaking。

 Well， what's so bad about it？， Here it's really good。

 like you're bringing a lot of authenticity out， which is good， it's like， oh。

 people are gonna laugh at me， we all have that， Now let's kind of sink into it， it's like， well。

 what's so bad if they do？ What's so bad about even right now， you running out of things to say？。

 What is that trigger？， This is where the whole self acceptance， like， if I run out of things to say。

 I need to depend on running out of things to say， Or similar， it's like， oh。

 I must keep this image intact， where people see through me and laugh， Well， it's usually in school。

 not remembering what to say， getting bad grades or criticism or in groups， social groups。

 gatherings， just people not liking me， I think， So as you can see here。

 there's a lot more intense sensations that are surfacing， you know。

 she's getting a lot more emotional， And that's because we're going deeper and deeper into the fear。

 you know， we're blasting through layers of resistance， Instead of just saying on the surface， like。

 social anxiety， okay， well， let's release that， go deeper， why， why， why， why， why？， You know。

 I'm directing her right into what she fears， what happens if you're anxious？

 I don't want people to see me nervous， why？， People not liking me， you know， boom。

 we're going right deeper and we're hitting on something really authentic here， Yeah， I think， yeah。

 I think that's it。 It's difficult， I don't really know。

 I understand it's all that's coming to my mind right now， Okay。

 what happens if people don't like you？ How did you feel？， Rejected。 Hello？， Just， yeah。

 not in a place I want to be。， Did ever happen in school you did around， I think。

 to say where people did laugh？， It's difficult， I don't know。， No。

 because I don't usually speak about in groups， so they don't talk in presentations， yeah。

 oral exams where I didn't know what to say anymore and I had a bad grade or just shaking voice。。

 Never people laughing or never in a bad way。， Okay， and as you can see here too。

 if you go through the fear， there's hurt。 Fear， anxiety is covering up， hurt。， Well， first of all。

 here's what I'll say is like， in terms of just how you guys feel off of this。

 you can sense the hardness。， It's like， you think at first it's like fear， in reality it's like。

 you don't want to feel like that， it's like you're fearing that hurt。， You're feeling like， okay。

 what if people do this？， And this is， again， it's like paradigm one is optimize it， so it's like。

 most people will tell you， okay， well， if you're hurt， here， practice these confident skills。。

 I'll give you this public speaking skill， I'll even give you a lot of opportunities to speak。

 so you'll get more use to it。， And that will be true， that will help to some extent。

 but it will never actually get to that cause where there's that fear of being hurt。。

 You'll just have more tools to keep running away and avoiding being fully authentic， vulnerable。

 and potentially being hurt。， And this is not just you， this is like everyone。。

 This is literally everyone， you want to link it to him， same thing， it's like， if they see past。

 if they see past， if they see past， why do we all fear rejection？， We don't want to be alone。

 we don't want to be abandoned， we don't want to be hurt， or even feel like we're bad。

 it's another one。， But then it's kind of examining， it's like diving into that， as we said。

 so it's like， well， what's so bad about that？， What is so bad about people laughing。

 people judging you？， You've been fully real putting yourself out there。

 and people just not accepting it。， And then it's zoning into the sensations。。

 So now we're finally aware of what it is we want to let go of。， By using the crowd。

 we made all those sensations surface， and then what I did is I just kept guiding her following that trail of wise。

 going deeper and sinking into it more and more and more。， And now that it's there。

 we're going to release it going through the process。 And I guess we'll do this here with you。

 and we'll just do it all together。 Have a seat。， This is， this is， first of all， yeah， really。

 congrats。， Yeah， that's awesome。， Yeah， which， by the way， like， well， you just did here？ I mean。

 you guys fucking all know， it's like， it requires so much fucking balls。， And it's insane。 And。

 yeah， I mean， for you， which was interesting， it's like， you really didn't put on that front。

 It was like immediately， boom， there。， And this is great too。 I mean。

 just getting this reference of nothing that happening and this huge crowd just cheering you on。。

 I mean， yeah， awesome。 It doesn't get to the cause， but what better reference would you want？。

 And it's so scary too。 It's like， oh， I don't want to go in front。

 And the fact that you came in front of everyone， it's like， this is what's up。

 Like I can guarantee you everyone fucking connected。 It wasn't like， oh， you know。

 it'd be way better than trying to be cool or anything like that。， No？ It's like， that's your like。

 holy shit。 And that's what stands out。 And again， it's like， that's what everyone's fucking craving。

 It's like， bring that out with other people and bring that out with yourself because the person we bullshit the most is ourselves。

， You know， you can bullshit the whole crowd here， but it's like， we just bullshit ourselves。

 So the fact you brought that out， really， really good。。

 And now it's like doing the opposite that is， let's dive into it。 And that's where it gets tough。

 And for me personally， like in front of a crowd， same thing as you。。

 Like my biggest fear growing up in school was reading a book。

 I think I might be a little bit dyslexic， but I sucked at reading out loud。 So bad。。

 And I was in Switzerland。 That's where I'm from。 Originally Switzerland。

 They make you read the book， you know， out loud in front of everyone and everyone's while they switch。

 Like you take over。 You take over at random。 And it felt like Russian roulette。 I was like， oh。

 my god。 Oh， my god。 Oh， my god。 And it took forever。 And you know， as your turn。

 And then it was like， it was so bad。 There was so much fear。。

 And my first seminar was the same thing。 Like I mean。

 you did better than me at my first fucking seminar by far。 Okay。 Same for you。

 Like those glimpses of authenticity。 And you were like still glimpses。， A little bit。

 A couple was better than anything I did。 Like my first seminar I went on stage was like。

 supposed to be 10 minutes。 This is like years ago in Los Angeles with Owen。 He's like， hey。

 come up on stage。 10 minutes。 Man， 10 minutes。， I'm just prepared something。 So I'm like， oh， fuck。

 My first assumption is somewhere to use like it's school all over again。

 But I got to do this willpower。 So I'm like， well。

 I'll find comfort in knowing exactly what I'm going to say。 So that's why I brought you up。

 It's like， now what？， You know， that's when authenticity authenticity kicks in。 But I'm like， okay。

 I'm going to work on exactly what I'm going to say。 Have it all prepared。 And I'm there。

 And it's a huge crowd。 It was like 200 people。 I think I was like， fuck scared。， I'm like， shit。

 listen to the back。 My buddy's like， you ready， bro？ You ready？ Like， oh， and walks in。 He's like。

 hey， man。 So it's actually going to be 30 minutes instead of 10。， Gone。 My whole plan gone。

 And he brings me up on stage。 And he like really， really like talks me up。 Like， you know， one。

 it's an extra challenge of trying to shove me in my head， but also like adding extra pressure。

 So he like talks five minutes。 Like really loud。， So it's like， like kind of like here。

 Like you guys are not talking。 Imagine like for five minutes， if I just keep talking really loud。

 you're going to kind of fall more into spectator than actually being here。， Presence。 If I'm like。

 so， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no。 For like， why would you be like。

 kind of your head？ And I'm like， your turn。， It's like that。 And he's like。

 what Julian's going to say is the best content you've ever heard in your life。 So I'm like， oh。

 my god， so everyone's expecting the best shit。 Take it away。 And I'm like， it was so bad。。

 And I remember it was like， there was massive nervousness。 It required a lot of efforts。

 And there was so much self-judgment too， which is key。， I had my whole thing prepared。

 And I remember I missed a point。 And the entire rest of the seminar。

 instead of just being here with it， I was in my head being like， you fucking idiot。 It's fucked now。

 You missed that point。 God， it was horrible。， And there was no， it was me like against the crowd。

 me trying to win the crowd over with like force。 And so being like， hey， we're all here。 It's like。

 it's so funny。 I'm assuming like everyone's here working on themselves。

 Like this is the most positive， friendly environments。 Any of us could be in。， You know。

 it's pretty great。 I mean， yeah， fuck yeah。 It's。。。， It is。 Yet our mind still always assumes。

 oh my god， oh my god， oh my god。 You know。， So I was like that。 And then， you know。

 a lot of references， like I've mastered the going against。 And I mean。

 I don't know if you guys know it's like， if you guys read a previous one like a year or two ago。

 two years ago， three years ago， maybe， very different vibe than now。， You know， it's still powerful。

 It's like， it's the different place。 You know？ And I can still go on like， really fucking loud。

 Still bring it。， But it's no longer forced me against you。 And when this happened for me。

 as a little sign of when this became permanent， it was only when I released all of that stuff that was fueling that anxiety。

， You know， that self-judgment， that mean versus the crowd， get to the cause and let it go。， Okay。

 but this is a great example of， you know， using different environments to trigger you， if you will。

 and then just keep going deeper and deeper and deeper。， And then with her here， of course。

 it's letting go of them going through the process。 And yeah。

 letting go of that charge fueling that anxiety。 That's how you make it fucking permanent。

。
