 you just have this， and when I saw this， I was like， praying and smiling，贏了， 贏了，是好的词，这都是坟。 母叫，你撒谷彈。

 一会儿太难，但最后可以完成，就是不會開始，如果要自己的人，才會去 usable，未來上網，應該會存在，大家都報告， Genau， 나는第一次出來，如果大家有多難，也不能一直下來，你沒有盡用。

現在變atos，因為我使用了，就2000次，我繼續提堂，那麼不破壞，我一直以來，中國已經獲得現易，就是真的，我還以為，台灣，警察， think about pussy like a。

 there now we're alive， this is like bring that out， you what do you find passionate， not hustling。

 what do you find， what are you passionate about， i gotta be honest with you， yes。

 what i find really， what i'm really passionate， i'm afraid， yes， please， one day。

 i will look into the mirror， i'll see myself， so good， so proud， like huge， how to describe it。

 the details， i'm gonna be so ripped， i'm gonna have veins all over my stomach。

 i'm sorry i'm gonna fucked up， maybe it's not a nut but a bit， i'm gonna have， so to the crowd。

 just bring in the crowd， even louder， if you are more passionate， you'd be so fucking loud。

 seven fucking cars， alright， now if you all do a little different。

 for you it's like here we kinda tapped in that passion， for you， amp it up even more。

 so think right now you're delivering Shakespeare on fucking stage， it's like this is。

 you're preaching， right now it's like， just like you're fucking preaching， i want a full range。

 i want loud and more quiet and more fast and more slow， you know， it's like when i'm talking。

 if i was like， it's still good but still kind of stiff， it's like。

 and again you're in front of a crowd， but if i was like， so everyone， with abundance。

 what i really want， and it's like， it's cool， it's better than， oh it's a abundance。

 it's like yeah it's cool， but it's not like that same， it doesn't fucking bring people in。

 like i want that， it's like， add the emotion， like i want real passion。

 because that doesn't feel like real passion， it's like， it's like， real emit， that's what i want。

 like a life， whatever it is， it's not the thing， what makes you feel alive， if it's nothing。

 this is something everyone should think about， because if you don't know what turns you on。

 good luck， dumb it down， anything just fucking out of that passion， so， think it's like this。

 when i have like， my average date， like i'm one university， i'm studying， i'm studying my shit。

这是个好好的预结，当时我做过解之后， Keep more personal don't go into stories。

 keep more personal just narrate what you feel， how hard is it？，我 always knew that I'm special。

 I always knew that there is something about there for me， But I haven't found it yet。

 It's freaking me to fuck up， It's freaking me to fuck out guys， Seriously。

 And I'm gonna find it one day， I can't tell you for fuck a shirt， I'm gonna find it one day。

 You can find it now if you let loose， and you finally stop keeping yourself caged in man。

 That's what I'm saying， It's like you're in that hustle like， No， I'm trying to force it。

 You can't force it， It's like just at some point， Fuck it， Fuck that front。

 And notice that you just keep going those same narratives， Talking about passion。

 Talking about hustle， Fuck the narratives， Destruct the patterns， Bring some realness out。

 Like if I were you dude like， Honestly right now like， What I'd be feeling is shit。

 I can't bring it out， Fuck why can't I bring it out， I'd talk about that。

 versus I'm gonna find the passion people， Fuck that shit， That's like some dumb story you're saying。

 I want realness， I want authenticity， We'll talk about that shit。

 Don't tell them what they want to hear， It's only where you're actually feeling， If you're confused。

 Harness that， Talk about the confusion， It's really difficult， Because not it is like that。

 I'll stop you there man， Like， Like， Like， Like， Man， Man， When you look at what's saying to you。

 Have you one never tried what you want to try， What you're saying to you that you will never find what you want to lie。

 The meaning of your lie， I have a question about that， Think about that， Honestly。

 You will never find， And you will die tomorrow， Well let's bring it out。

 Let's bring it out with a couple of sizes， Like what I will say is like， This should be like。

 Like I， If I were you， Would be like so pissed on myself right now， It's insane。

 You don't look pissed at all， I'd be like honestly like， You're here。

 You have this opportunity to express yourself， And you fuck it up like a little pussy。

 You don't even try， It's not even fucking it up， Trying， It's you pussyed out。

 And honestly like this is the most disappointing shit I've ever seen。

 And like I don't even know what to do， It's like， I'm disgusted by it， Straight up disgusted。

 And again， Does that make you feel like smiling？， He's like， No， It's like be disgusted。

 Aren't you disgusted？， Like what do you feel right now？， I feel like I still have a smile。

 You still have to buy it？， Yeah you're still hooked on that story， Drop that story dude。

 Like the fact that right now， Like I'm like you're disgusted， And it does nothing to you。

 You're just like， But I gotta find it， I gotta find it， What the fuck are you like so lost。

 You're just in lost touch with reality， I gotta find it， I gotta find it。

 Like if you walk down the street， And someone gets hit by a car and dies。

 Is that gonna be your unit feel something？， Or you'd be like， I gotta find it， I gotta find it。

 I must find it， Can everyone？， Oh dead person， I must find it， Get out of your head man。

 Okay now obviously I'm not disgusted， Like I'm saying this to provoke shit。

 And the fact that it's not provoking shit， That should be the warning。

 Like you gotta get in your body man， Gotta bring some fucking authenticity， I see this fake front。

 This constructed fake front， I'm gonna find it， No one's gonna be pissing you for finding it。

 I'm so perfect I'm chasing my passion， Is anyone not like chasing passion？， Is anyone against that？。

 Everyone approves of me， And someday I will find it， Is anyone against that？， Finding it someday？。

 No？， Okay， Fuck that dude， Fuck this narrative， Realness， Authenticity， Tell them what you feel。

 Stop trying to be so perfect and cool， If you feel frustrated， If you feel sad。

 If you feel like fuck why can't I do it， Harness that， What do you feel right now？， I gotta find it。

 I gotta find it， Share it， What do you feel？， I feel like a mixture of feelings。

 I feel like someday you're gonna find it， Someday I have fun， Someday， I feel like。

 I'm spinning circle， I can guarantee you this， You want so well to do right， And so does everyone。

 We're trying so well to be right， If I do everything right， People will like me。

 People are craving authenticity， It's not about right or wrong， They want authenticity， We crave it。

 There was a guy last， Was it last week？， Yeah， it was last week in Amsterdam。

 He had a different kind of constructed front， You have the very self-help junkie front。

 He had the class clown front， Who was that Amsterdam？， You remember the guy。

 He was like kind of class clowny， Kind of like some people here， Like， oh， bring me up， bring me up。

 And it's like， yeah， he puts on the front， He's like， hi， everyone， Yeah， I'm in front of the stage。

 It's good， it's a very well crafted front， Now， I'm kind of a dick。

 And I use my game skills for this， To kind of pierce through that， I pretty much do the same thing。

 I'm like， dude， this shit's discussing， I never hang out with you， And he's like。

 why are you laughing？， Like， Luke， until it broke down， And he didn't have a choice， He's like。

 yeah， I kind of don't feel good， And then we brought him back up， But like， that glute。

 Of even him admitting， you know， I kind of feel stupid， And yeah， it is a front。

 Connected with fucking everyone， And everyone right now， That's why they're on your side。

 They don't care it's like， what you say， They just want to see， It's like， because it。

 Or wakes that shit in them， It's like， let's see some realness， That's all they want。

 It's not about the front， It's not about the right， It's like， where's the authenticity？。

 What's actually going on？， That's it， That's what turns people on。

 And stop buying into this little lie， It's like， fuck that little programming shit， What's real？。

 And that's what's also the point， And that's what's also the point。

 And that's what's also blocking you from going deep， Like， what happens if I don't do it？。

 Hope I'm going to find it， I'm going to find it， I'm going to find it， What's real？。

 Start being honest with yourself， Until you do that too， you're never going to really like yourself。

 Because you never are honest with yourself， Okay， I got it， I got it， I got it， What do you get？。

 I'm going to find it to everyone， What do you get？， What do you get？， Please， please， please。

 please， Please， please， what do you get？， I get it， I'm fucked up， I get it， I'm fucked up， No。

 you're not， Just stop trying， just let people see you， What are you afraid they're going to see？。

 What are you afraid people are going to see if you stop telling them you're going to find it？。

 What's so bad about that？， Now， just this pause， pause， pause， like， Look at the crowd right now。

 This， even though there's not that fucking passion， loudness。

 Usually you can awaken it through that， There's a little glimpse of authenticity。

 And I can guarantee you right now， correct me if I'm wrong。

 You can all connect a lot fucking more right now， We love you， Matt。

 There's a lot more love for you right now than with that front， Hi， And again， it's like。

 you're funny enough， It's very easy to kind of be like， oh I'm a victim now， I'm so far out there。

 It's like， no， everyone's like this， I'm like this， but like that's where you got to go。

 That's where you're going to find， what's it called？， Hit him right there。

 that's where you'll find it， It's right there in that authenticity。

 And that's what everyone should ideally bring out， And everyone's going to remember that。

 It's like someday， I wouldn't find it， But even that look in the eyes。

 And usually it does feel like you do feel a little bit hurt， But as again。

 it's like those life crisis points， It's like that pain and transformation， they're always linked。

 And it's not pain in the same way where you're like， Pushing yourself and shit。

 it's pain because it's melting away bullshit， And that's like ego pain， And for this by the way。

 you want to go even deeper， It's like when you hear develop a perverted pleasure in the pain。

 It's not in the pain of always kicking your own ass， like carrot stick。

 It's developing a perverted pleasure in the pain with this melting away of shit。

 Because right now what do you just do with this crowd？ You took your ego。

 And just fucking bomb on the chair， You're literally beating your ego up， And that's why it hurts。

 But that's the tight， it's like subtleties， nuances， places coming from， That's the pain。

 this is the pain， Every time you put on a fake ass front， you get rejected。

 Like there's a part of you that knows， Bring that realness， You bring this out。

 you'll connect with anyone， You go out tonight， you bring this out， you'll stand out。

 Don't try to be so perfect， so good， so right， real， Fuck right， be real， No matter what that is。

 we underestimate the value of authenticity， This is what we're all after。

 This is even with this escape， What am I inspired to do？ Inspiration's authentic。

 That's what we're here， that's what people want to see， And you brought out a bit， man。

 which is fucking。。。， Really good， I appreciate it， Yeah， it's good something， good thing， Yeah。

 Basically the thing is， okay， I get it now， if he was right all the time， And obviously。

 And what's actually true is， It's hard to accept yourself as you are， For something， For everyone。

 I get it， And deep down inside， I don't give a fuck what's any going on， Think about it。

 but I'm also insecure like everyone， It's consciously。

 we don't give a fuck because we're also taught， Like be strong， don't give a fuck， One side of me。

 like， thinks， man， you're awesome， you need to maintain， That self-image and stuff。

 and the other part， It's like， you're not dead good， I don't know。

 you weren't so popular in high school or whatever， Yep， conscious subconscious， No。

 it's conscious subconscious， I must do it， I must do it， So， consciously you're hanging onto that。

 it's like you're always dragging it， Bring that up and trust me， it's like。

 There won't require so much effort and the she'll be permanent， Because that's true， it's like。

 if you're in that optimized paradigm， the scarcity paradigm。

 You'll never fully get where you want to go， Like， again， you'll never find the， 液液 guy， Say，液液 guy。

 you'll never find it， And it's always requires effort to maintain。

 Because you're always dragging that or you're running away from your fate of falling。

 If you bring this up to speed， you'll finally get there and it's permanent， And there's no effort。

 Like here， you can look up some of my older videos， There's some where I come up on stage。

 it's like， I think they're still really good， But it's like， there's effort for me to do that。

 You get addicted to whatever you're feeling the most， Like literally。

 if you're someone who's always negative， you're going to find reasons to feel negative。

 If you're someone who's always stressed out， you're going to look for reasons to feel stressed out。

 If you're someone who is used to basically being in that victim mentality and used to rationalize。

 And used to rationalize why you're not taking action。

 you're going to start identifying with that person， Be like， wow， I am now that person。

 And I will not let go of that， I'm trying to find every reason， every excuse to fall into that。

 And no matter what anyone tells me， I'm going to find a way to slip back into that mode。

 And you can kind of sense like the， it's like just think battery like charger， Like。

 ssss type of energy， Or it's kind of like this， Like here， it's powerful， but a lot more to lose。

 And here， I'm a lot louder， being modest， A lot funnier， a lot more charismatic， A lot smarter。

 A lot wiser， no effort， It's that， You got to top it now， You're like， I'm going to use my。

 I need to go right now， Thanks for having me， Yes， you may go， Yeah， I'm going to do it for you。

 Now， Good， What are you passionate about？， Now for you， now there's extra pressure because like， oh。

 expectations， try to nuke that， Don't try to copy him， because this is something we have， It's like。

 oh， with that person， did well， I must copy him or be as loud for you， It's。

 do you the best you can do， And it could be even louder， it could be quite like real him in， Mm-hmm。

 Go， okay， Okay， well I'm really passionate about， and this might sound a little crazy。

 Because there's like a bunch of guys sitting here going for pickup。

 I really want to do something for the female community not being so fucked up anymore。

 Because I was。。。， Let emotions take over， you're logically explaining it。

 just jump in from the start， from the start， Okay， I was completely fucked up my whole life。

 like I was like overweight， I got teased by everybody， I was a miserable， sad， very。

 very sad person， And now what is happening to my life right now is like I start to experience acting like。

 no， sorry， Being in contact with a person not from a spot of neediness， you know。

 like I just experience it， And this is what is like super amazing to me right now。

 You turned on where you said that， dive into that， what is that experience， how is it different？。

 Detail， like once you hit something， like， like do you have those words， like， you know， I did this。

 I did this， That was still kind of storyline， like narrative， you know， this is my story。

 this is why I don't work on， And what I realized is I experienced something not from neediness。

 and then you lit up， Boom， dive into that， what's not from neediness， what's different。

 how is it good？， Okay， one second， this is far scary， but I thought， Yeah， no， it's true。

 front like personal， approximately enough here， yeah， Okay。

 just talk and let yourself get carried away by what you're saying， Okay。

 so like I experienced with a friend of like I never trusted my inner voice， you know。

 like when I was around guys especially I was like， Does he like me， does he not like me， oh my god。

 I'm too fat， I'm too ugly， I have all this shit going on in my head。

 And then I make this experience where I'm like， like， he's a person that I know pretty well。

 and it's like， All of a sudden， like， I feel this attraction to this person， and it's like。

 does he feel that too？ I don't know， I think there's something happening， but no， no， no， no， no。

 no， this is totally， this is just in your head， And then eventually something happened， and。。。。

 I'll pause you again， okay， Passion or storyline， storyline， I want a live。

 like this is not you alive， like when you're talking about like think of it this way。

 you go home tonight and you see a UFO， Like an alien， it's like， what's your name？ It's like。

 sub-vicky， like gone， like， whoa， you're like， whoa， it's like， like you're super psych。

 You're probably gonna be very excited to tell this to someone， like， oh my god， you know what。

 I just fucking spook you， UFO， That， where it's like， you know even。

 care really where you're saying it's like， check this out， that's the vibe I want here， Here。

 this is not the excitement that you would have if you saw UFO， I want that， whatever it is。

 it might not even be this story， it's like， what？， Fucking brings that， like， keeps you， like。

 you just get carried away， you get so lost， you even forget you're here， you forget about the crowd。

 You get so turned on， but what you're saying， and it's not even the content so much。

 it's like that energy， like， check this out， What is it？

 I'm looking for something that I'm that passionate about， and it's。。。， So talk about that。

 It's not happening right now， so I feel like， what the fuck am I gonna say， you know。

 like in my head it's like， okay， find something， find something， find something。

 There has to be something that you're passionate about， you know， like。

 why don't you have anything to be passionate about， what the fuck is wrong with you。

 And so here I am， like， talking about that， that's better， Now， we're gonna， like。

 night and day versus the previous one， but I want to stamp it up even more， Okay。

 I'll keep pushing it， just think more， like， zone in on the feelings， Like， your mantra。

 whenever you do this， like， should be， and I love this， how does it feel？， Whatever you're saying。

 it's like， tada tada， how am I anxious， how does it feel？ And it makes me feel this， and this， like。

 carried away， What do you feel right now？， This whole， I'm all super passionate about this， Okay。

 Tell him， tell him， harness that， I was surprised， tada tada， whatever it is， unleash it。

 I was like， am I doing something wrong， what the fuck is he doing， how did I feel？， Not logically。

 like， let it show in the way you talk， I know， you're there， you're there， like， one step further。

 It's not happening right？， Here's how we're gonna unleash it， Okay， We're gonna do。

 I really do wanna unleash it， That's what I'm saying， you feel it， like， that's what I'm saying。

 like， we all have this， Like， we all know how to be super funny， loud， charismatic， like， well。

 I'm bringing in， but it's like there's blockage， Okay， so one way we're gonna do here， like。

 for you， it's kinda like pressing it like， like， like， that， with you。

 we're gonna actually make you scream， No， Yes， that's where the fear is， Now， with the screaming。

 okay， and we're all gonna do this by the way after， but， like， with the screaming， view it as again。

 It's like， it's a good tool to get you there to remind you， but， again， ideally。

 you should naturally be there， But， for the screaming。

 what we're gonna do is we're actually gonna go back and forth， I'll even take this off。

 where it's cheating， Try to top me every time， so we're gonna do， like， uh， uh， uh， uh， uh。

 and then eventually I'm gonna do， now go， And I want you to keep talking， fucking loud， like。

 with that unleasiness， Huh？， Okay？， Whatever the fuck comes up， Okay， So， loud as you can， I start。

 I just scream， Or what is it？， Like， I scream as loud as I can， Don't think， do， AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH。

 AAAAAAAAHHHHH， AAAAAAHHHHH， Even more， AAAAAAAHHHHH， AAAAAAHHHHH， Now talk， bring it。

 Just don't think， do， I'm fucking playing League of Legends， Louder， AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH， Oh， my God。

 Oh， my God， Oh， my God， Dude， that was， That was it。

 I honestly couldn't have thought of a better example， It's like， oh， my passion， League of Legends。

 when I played it like， that's what turns you on， Yes， And now it's like， that aliveness， Like。

 actually look at the crowd， That aliveness， the brightness and the pupils， the smile。

 the genuine smile， That's what you gotta connect with， You know， And then of course， it's like。

 once you harness that， you allow yourself to bring it like， whenever you， you know。

 It doesn't take away from the passion， like， see you want to build a business， so on and so forth。

 But like， that's the aliveness we all want to get in touch with， Alright， so yeah， really。

 congratulations， Like， really fucking good， Really good。
