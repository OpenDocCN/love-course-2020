所以，最第一，集團控制 when it comes to people pleasing，是我們兒子一人 peaceuppliesers，蹭不去 就連人 who says yes。

 Ск說 because of everyone， who assigned alla time，那些是人人多是人多而ank， Ciao， we all put on this front。

 During our upbringing，， in order to please，， in order to fit in，， in order to not be abandoned。

 and in order to survive。， Who we are，， we came up with it，， we put on that front in order to please。

， in order to survive。， Okay，， and that front can take many forms。。

 It could be someone who's nice all the time，， agreeable all the time，， says， yes all the time。。

 But it could also be someone who's mean all the time，， someone who's miserable all the time，。

 someone who says， no all the time。， Whatever the front is，，階段是 front，You zwitz，你可突然些人， including。

求構，就，有，任何，如果，你，就，要，給，而，鬥，但是，作用，力AC，做，不要， las，全，總， und so of this belief too that you must never offend anyone。

You know， it's like I must always agree with everyone， it's like no。

 you're not meant to get along with everyone， and not everyone is meant to get along with you。

 and that's fine， be ok with disagreeing sometime， The the thing I was still， myself is。

 what's the intention behind it， that's the key， it's not， it might be nice or mean。

 it's do have good intentions behind， what I'm expressing right now。

 and it could be disagreeing with someone， but are the intentions good，哦，有一种不轻便，乱菜，有没有，仙色，我觉得，是Tua。

没关系，在什么事情，这是最大的心思，竟然inquish，愿意，我也谷歉，是否我很害怕，你 were saying is like，，Yeah， this sounds awesome。。

 Am I going to do it at home？， It's so easy to put it off。， And this is what's cool of on one hand。

 having me here where it's like，， you have， like I'm saying，， why， why， like I'll keep pressing。

 and also kind of having the pressure of the crowd， where it's now it's like a big deal。， It's like。

 you know，， you can't resort to escaping anymore， because that's what you usually do。， It's like。

 this kind of kicks in。， It's like， am I not important？， Oh， just distract yourself。。

 Don't interest that。， That's not pleasant。， Here it's like， we're going to go right in there。。

 So why？， Why don't you think you're important？， Because I don't feel like people。

 would care if I told them what I felt。， And this here is extremely common。

 when it comes to people pleasing，， you know， that feeling that you are not important。

 because what you're doing when you're putting on this front。

 is you keep abandoning yourself over and over and over again。， You know。

 you keep abandoning yourself， telling yourself，， you're not important。

 and you keep placing other people above you。， Okay， this is what happens when you're like，。

 you know， I care too much about what people think， must always be pleasing。， It's all about them。。

 There's never what about me，， what about your needs，， what about what's going on inside。。

 You're like， fuck that。， Let's please them。， If I meet someone and I want their approval，。

 I must do whatever I can to please them and make them happy。， It's all about them， you know。。

 I don't know if they'll like this joke，， so let's hide that joke。。

 So that little inner voice you have of authenticity，， let's just say you just keep ignoring it。。

 And guess what？， With time on repeat，， your sense， your self-esteem，。

 your sense of self is just gone， you know？， And of course， you know，。

 you end up just feeling like you're not important。， And then what happens？。

 It's a whole fucking loop。， You're like， well， I'm not important。， So I mean more approval，。

 must please even more， must please even more。， Okay， and the cycle。， Okay， where did that come from？

， Why do you think that？， I think it's from being rejected， when I have actually opened up。， Okay。。

 When did you open up what happened？， We're gonna dive in also more emotionally。， Here。

 a lot of it is just kind of letting， those emotions come up， kind of tuning into what it is。。

 We need to process。， But for now， it's like， let's just take an example。

 and you're probably an experienced a lot of resistance to this。， Like， hey， wins one time。。

 You can remember right now，， like you did open up and you were rejected。。

 Because that's probably the same fear， that's kind of coming up here。。

 Because what am I making you do？， Literally open up in front of a fucking crowd。。

 So now there's like， oh my God，， if you do this or get rejected，， you're gonna get rejected。。

 Where did that come from？， What was one previous experience where you did get rejected？。

 And how did that feel？， Like replay it， put it out there and go through it。。

 And I know this is like the hardest thing， you could possibly do。。

 But that's why you gotta take the benefit， of the pressure of the crowd。

 where it's like no running away from it。， And that's， I just wanna reinforce as well。。

 As long as you keep running away from something，， similar to that abundance。

 it's gonna keep staying there。， And you're gonna keep reinforcing it。。

 And that's what's like really hard too，， is like step one， like say you feel really。

 really miserable，， really， really like in pain，， there's all these negative emotions。， It's like。

 yeah， step one，， do whatever you can to get out of that。， Again， positivity challenge。

 whatever the fuck， is better than feeling just horrible。， Like do it。。

 But realize like it's still not the end goal。， Because as long as you're like must be happy，。

 must feel good all the time，， you're gonna continuously keep escaping， these other painful emotions。

， And it's only until you fully dive into them， and realize， hey， it's all good。。

 So you can finally like feel abundance， or feel at ease and no longer feel this constant need。

 of running away from running towards。， So here it's like whatever you're running away from。。

 Like this is usually the stuff， that you even pop in when you're sitting home alone。。

 So you say home， it's like，， it starts bubbling up，， let's dive into it。

 and kind of use this environment， to make yourself do it。， So what's one example。

 where you opened up and really got rejected？， And it just like really， really hurt。。

 And it was really like traumatizing。， I know it's hard， I know。， Just know that the crowd's there。。

 If you just want to focus on me， just focus on me。， I just can't come up with a concrete example。

 really。， Most likely a lot of those experiences， where you say you did open up。

 and you were rejected for it， you shoved them down。。

 And most likely a lot of it happened when you were really young， but let's just say， I don't know，。

 just think of the most recent one。， Even if it's like a small scale one，。

 like did you ever go through a breakup when that happened？。

 Did you ever meet someone when that happened？， When was sometime it's like again，。

 always people pleasing。， It's like you want to please everyone。。

 What's so bad if you don't please everyone？， Because that's with people pleasing。。

 It's like you're trying to always conform， to the person you're talking to。， And we all have it。。

 It's like do you guys ever say yes when you want to say no？， So you're people pleasing。。

 Everyone's like， no， it's like， no。， So most likely it's like people pleasing。。

 It's like you always want to fit in。， And kind of leaning into people seeing the real you。

 when you are people pleasing，， they never do see the real you。。

 They always see that front that you put on。， And you can kind of experience it too。。

 Like you'll see in different relationships。， And this is something where if you use relationships。

 in your benefit， it'll help big time。， Because with people pleasing，。

 you can fake it enough to kind of get， in the beginning of a relationship。。

 But for a relationship to really like blossom，， you need to truly be authentic and put yourself out there。

， And once your partner kind of sees like you can't do that，。

 there's still all these aspects that you hide。， There's no longer that trust。。

 There's no longer that intimacy。， And in a way for the other person too，， it becomes very boring。。

 Because you're just a mirror of that person。， So it'll keep blocking you from really connecting。

 with someone authentically。， But then there's that fear too。， Well。

 what if they do see the real you？， What's so bad about them seeing the real you？。

 What's so bad about them even rejecting the real you？， Whatever comes to mind。。

 Say I open up and then the other person says like，， no， that's okay。， You shouldn't feel like that。。

 Yeah。， And I get a lot of that。， Like for my family and my siblings， siblings。， And yeah。。

 So shamed to feel what you're feeling？， Yeah， exactly。。

 What are some of the emotions they don't want you to feel， or they say you shouldn't feel like that？

， Like anxious or sad or angry。， Here or two， what's interesting is we think we would feel comforted。

 when someone tells you like， hey， you shouldn't feel bad。， But in reality， that makes things worse。。

 Just be aware of it next time you're maybe with a friend， or a loved one and they're experiencing，。

 let's just say， some sadness。， And you're like， you shouldn't feel that bad。。

 You shouldn't feel sad。， It'll be okay。， That's not what they want to hear。。

 Because you're making them feel like it's not okay to feel sad。， In reality。

 what we all crave in a moment of sadness， for example，， is someone to just be with us， you know。。

 And to accept the fact that we're sad。， And be with us with the sadness， if you will，。

 versus labeling the sadness as bad and making us feel wrong， about feeling what we're feeling。。

 It's more so， it's okay to feel sad。， It's okay to be feeling what you're feeling。

 and I'm there with you for that。， Okay。， So what happens if you do show anger or sadness？。

 What are you feeling right now？， Actually， let's do this。， This is a good little exercise。。

 And we'll keep going deeper。， Narrate what's going on in your head， or emotionally just right now。。

 Like， we all have that little voice in our head。， Step one in terms， like say， hey。

 be in a real fuck it。， Stop putting on the front is just starting narrating it。， So literally。

 whatever that voice is saying right now in your head。， Like， when I'm saying it， you're like， oh。

 fuck。， What is it making me like that？， Verbalize it。， Literally verbalize whatever is going on。。

 Don't judge it。， It could be like， oh my god， fuck，， Julian， why did you bring me up on stage？。

 I don't care what it is。， Verbalize it。， So I make or do that exercise of narrating。

 what's going on inside。， Okay， fuck the front， fuck micromanaging，， what you're saying。

 what's coming out，， get rid of all the filters and just say it。， Because that's what happens。。

 We think something， we're like， is this okay to say？， Is it okay to express it？。

 Does it fit the front here？， No， yes。， Okay， it's like there's this bar。， Is this okay？， No。， Yes。。

 And the more， let's just say， extreme of a people pleaser， you are， the higher the bar。。

 All of this is not okay。， Only this is okay。， So what I'm doing here is let's get rid of this fucking bar。

， Just say whatever's on your mind right now， and use this as a stepping stone。

 to get one step closer to being authentic again。， To remind you what it feels like to be authentic。

 and to stop having this little front。， No， I'm just。。。， When I get nervous。

 I turn very red in my face and my chest。， So。。。， Do this for like two minutes。。

 I don't like to own a thing I think about。， Your thing is on there right now。， Yeah。， Verbalize it。

 For two minutes， just verbalize it。， Verbalize it。 Verbalize it。 Verbalize it。。

 Verbalize the resistance to it。， You're like， oh no， I can't。。

 I feel like that if I verbalize it this，， I'm trying to come up with excuses not to verbalize it。。

 I'm trying to， you know， talk my way out of it。， Did it， whatever it is， verbalize that。。

 I just feel like when I。。。， If people in the crowd have noticed it yet，， and I say it。

 or I feel it more，， they will see it。， Okay， I like it。。

 And you're still talking and verbalizing a bit of it，。

 but it's still kind of explaining it to the crowd。， Make it really personal。。

 Like that voice talking to you， let it out。， I just feel awkward in the way I say it。

 because I have all this knowledge of how to be open， in your body language。

 but I still see my legs crossed，， and my arms crossed， and。。。。

 That's funny enough that's being open。， Yeah。， It's talking about how you're afraid of being open。。

 It's like it's fine if you're crossed。， Like you telling people you feel uncomfortable about，， well。

 maybe I'm not open enough by being like this，， that's you being open。， So continue that。。

 That little voice just start narrating it。， Express it。， I'd do the more comfortable right now。

 right here。， I want two minutes of it。， Non-stop。， Two minutes？， We all have that little voice。。

 Two minutes non-stop。， If you don't know what to say， verbalize。。

 I don't really know what to say right now。， Like whatever is going on。

 that's what you want to need to verbalize。， Yeah。， I'm not very good at English，。

 so it feels kind of awkward sitting here。， You're from obviously just giving people a little talk in English。

， Good。， Um， yeah。， Oh， this is so awkward。， Good。， Keep going。， No， it's making me nervous。。

 Keep following。， Keep going。， Keep going。， That's the step one。， Okay。。

 Now obviously like you really want to resolve this subconsciously， and emotionally。

 but step one for anyone who's like stuck in this， like people pleaser mentality。

 which is most of us，， it's doing something like this。， It's just verbalizing what's on your mind。。

 And I can guarantee you， you just doing that。， Like it hits everyone watching you on an authentic level。

， Like that's the shit where you're like，， whoa， like you actually see the human side。。

 It's no longer the front of like， okay， I'm here on stage。， I'm doing the exercise。， It's like。

 whoa。， You know， and that's also when you connect with everyone on a deep level too，， because again。

 the more personal the wound， the more universal。， Like does anyone actually kind of feel the same way where you're like。

， oh shit， like that's what kind of stood out。， Yeah。， You know。， And we think it's the opposite。。

 We think it's when we put on this cool front that people like us，。

 and we always underestimate the value of authenticity。。

 And the same in like just social interactions。， If you're always going out and you're talking to people。

 trying to put on this cool front，， it's like， yeah， I mean。

 it's better than not going out and interacting with people，。

 but you're still not breaking out of this people pleaser mentality。。

 Trying to be cool is being a people pleaser。， Trying to be a bad boy is being a people pleaser。。

 Trying to be a nice guy is a people pleaser。， Stop trying to be so nice， start being more real，。

 and start getting actual reference experiences like you're getting now， of you being real like this。

， Now， of course， you can even go deeper like， okay， well， what is real， you know？。

 But just start narrating authentically what's going on。， If you run out of things to say。

 the best thing to do is，， hey， I ran out of things to say。， And you think， oh。

 the person won't like mock you， but in reality，， there's that authenticity。。

 And that's really what's missing。， It's like， we all have this front。， You know。

 I can guarantee you too， although， oh， my God，， I'm nervous and you said I'm nervous。。

 That felt a lot better than trying to hide the nervousness。， You know。

 and that's kind of those first references you want to get，， but it's like， it's okay。。

 Because that's really what realizing， you know，， it's like abundance is your default。， It's real。

 like， it's fully，， it's the ultimate form of self-acceptance。。

 It's accepting who you are consciously and everything that's， in your subconscious。

 accepting and validating everything， you went through and everything you're feeling。。

 Whatever you're feeling， if it's okay to feel that，， it's good。， It'll just like move through you。。

 The thing is， we're like， this is bad， this is bad，， this is bad。

 and we keep suppressing and hanging on to shit。， No， it's totally okay。， Who says it's bad？。

 You know？， So keep going。， I know you thought it was over。， What kicked in now？， You're like， okay。

 keep going。， What thought came in？， What emotion came in？， Nerry that。， When I said keep going。。

 Just， yeah。， I don't know。， I don't feel nervous anymore。， It's quite nice。， Yeah。， Yeah。， Yeah。。

 Yeah， I don't know what to say。， I don't know what to say。， Yeah。， Yeah。， Really？， It's quite nice。

 just being quiet。， Really？， Yeah。， It's quite nice， just being quiet。， It's quite nice。

 just being quiet。， It's quite nice， just being quiet。， Oh， this is awful。， I don't like this。。
